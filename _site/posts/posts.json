In particular, is it someone who objects to the theory behind T, or is it someone who objects to the term T?\nIn class I was saying it was the former - someone who objects to the theory. But when I was reading more carefully for this week’s prep, there were certainly places where it looked like it was the latter. Still, I think, think, that the former reading is correct. The main reason for this is that when the term is introduced, it is credited to Kyle (2013). And in that paper it is unambiguous that the term means someone who objects to the theory behind T.\nWhy is it so confusing though? Well, because it’s part of the positive theory we’re going to get that people who disagree with the theory will typically be unhappy using the term. So in fact there will be, according to the positive theory, a massive overlap between the two groups. But even if that’s true, I think we’re meant to read it so by definition T-objectors object to the theory, and in practice T-objectors object to the term.\nWhat properties of T-objectors are meant to cause problems for the rival views?\nI’d really like to have a clear answer here, but I think I don’t. And that’s because I think there isn’t really meant to be any one snappy feature that is meant to be problematic for the rival view. So let’s circle round to it. Let’s use a different example from last time, ‘generous.’ (This is one that Kyle uses.)\nA simple problem for a semantic view of ‘generous’ (on which it entails good in some way) is that someone who denies that it is good to be generous will typically not deny “X is generous.” (Assume X does things that we normally describe as generous, but the objector thinks these are not good.) That’s easy to explain. There are lots of cases where we think sentence S entails proposition p, but someone who denies p won’t simply assert S with a negation slotted in somewhere.\nNor is the problem simply that the objectors won’t use the word ‘generous.’ That would also be easy to explain. If you think there is a term that non-conservatively extends the inferential logic of the language, and some of the new inferences are bad ones, you’ll not want to use it at all. And that would be a simple model of what the objectors think.\nThere are a couple of technical terms in that last paragraph that I should explain. In logic, a term is a ‘conservative’ extension of the language if adding it to the language only lets you prove new things involving the term. So if you have a language without ‘and,’ adding it lets you prove A, B, therefore A and B. But it doesn’t let you prove any new things not involving ‘and.’ On the other hand, the standard way to formulate classical logic (and a bunch of non-classical logics) is that adding ‘not’ is a non-conservative extension. In the language with ‘not,’ you can prove If A then B, or if B then A, which you couldn’t prove before, even though that doesn’t contain ‘not.’ Now there is a big dispute about whether it’s bad to have non-conservative terms in the language. But the standard view (the one that is built into the standard interpretation of classical logic) is that it’s fine, as long as those are good inferences.\nOne way to read Foot is that she thinks thick terms are non-conservative extensions in this sense, but the good thick terms are good non-conservative extensions. So think about how she treats ‘rude.’ She thinks you can infer from “X was offensive” to “X was rude.” And you can infer from “X was rude” to “X was wrong.” And maybe your language didn’t allow the inference “X was offensive” to “X was wrong” antecedently. At least, it wasn’t an analytic inference. If you’re opposed in principle to non-conservative extensions (and I’m a little opposed in principle to non-conservative extensions) you’ll think this is very very bad. But the orthodox view is that this is fine, provided they are good inferences. And, extending the orthodox view, if a putative term is a non-conservative extension and the new extended inferences are bad, the term literally doesn’t have a meaning. (If this isn’t too much of a distraction, I can talk about ‘tonk’ for a while at this point.)\nSo that’s to say, there is a very well worked out theory which would explain why T-objectors would never ever use the term T. But I think the argument is supposed to be that that theory isn’t right because they will sometimes use the term. And I think it is in things like rejecting (1) and accepting (2).\nIf X acted generously, X did something good in some way.\nWhether or not X acted generously, what X did was not good in any way.\nBut one big question - are those the data to be explained? Are there other data that need explaining too?\nWhat assumptions are we making here about the relationship between meaning and competent use?\nI think Väyrynen wants to argue as follows.\nRival views say that it is part of the meaning of ‘generous’ that being generous is good (in a way).\nBut some competent users of ‘generous’ use it in a way that would be incoherent if it is part of the meaning of ‘generous’ that being generous is good (in a way).\nSo it is not part of the meaning of ‘generous’ that being generous is good (in a way).\nNow as it stands, that’s invalid. We need an extra premise.\nCompetent users of a term do not use it in a way that is incoherent.\nAnd that premise is false. For example, some competent users of ‘if’ say that modus ponens is invalid. (My argument here draws heavily on Williamson (2007). His example of such a user is Vann McGee, and in particular the discussion of modus ponens in his (1985).) In general, any high level dispute about logic will involve competent users of a term using it incoherently. And we should wonder about Väyrynen’s opponent can do by comparing the objectors to deviant logicians. We certainly don’t want to argue that logic is incredibly weak because for just about any inference you can find some competent user who rejects the inference. As\nWhat exactly is meant to be wrong with the polysemy view?\nThe polysemy view, as I’m understanding it, is that terms like ‘generous’ are ambiguous between a meaning on which the have moral entailments, and a meaning on which they don’t. Väyrynen has a very quick discussion of polysemy in section 4.1. And then whenever it comes up in the book he refers back to this. But the arguments there don’t seem incredibly strong. They involve assumptions about which meaning the term would have in different contexts that don’t seem at all like compulsory assumptions for the polysemy theorist to make.\nThat said, it is worth spelling out the polysemy theory in some more detail. I’m saying ‘polysemy’ here not ‘ambiguity’ because no one thinks that ‘generous’ is ambiguous in the way that ‘bat’ or ‘bank’ are ambiguous. Whatever meaning plurality is there is like in ‘book’ or ‘newspaper.’ (Actually ‘book’ is very ambiguous, but I mean both of these have sort of type/token meaning pluralities.) So think about these two sentences.\nBrian bought a book.\nPeter bought a book.\nIf Brian is a bookshop customer, and Peter is an editor at a press, both of these things may be true, but they mean different things. I now own something that weighs a few ounces and is worth a few dollars, Peter owns something with zero weight, but potentially a lot of value. We call this ‘polysemy’ not ‘ambiguity’ because while there are multiple meanings here, it’s not completely random that the two meanings go together. Indeed, you might think that these are the only real ambiguities. It’s not that ‘bat’ has two meanings, but that there are two English words with the same spelling/pronunciation. Relatedly, you’d be surprised to find a language where the translations of the two occurrences of ‘book’ had (radically) different spellings/pronunciations.\nBut could this be what’s going on with ‘generous.’ On reflection, it doesn’t seem super plausible. The two meanings don’t have that kind of relation. There are better examples however. Think about something that has changed meaning over time. (Here is a list of 20 such words from the Dean of LSA - https://ideas.ted.com/20-words-that-once-meant-something-very-different/.) During the meaning change, it presumably had two meanings. But meaning changes are typically not random, though they do occasionally involve reversing polarity. So these will be cases of polysemy, not ambiguity.\nAnd that’s one way to think about about the T-objectors. They think the meaning of the term should change. Sometimes they will push that forward by using the term with the intended new meaning. But more often they will not use the term, because it will be hard for others to know that they intend to use it with a non-standard meaning. I don’t really see how that’s a worse explanation than what Väyrynen offers, though to be fair I’m not 100% sure what the data is we’re supposed to explain.\nDo these terms pass standard tests for polysemy/ambiguity?\nThe standard way to test whether a term is ambiguous is to get an instance of the term in a sentence where it is meant to do double-duty, and see if a single token can carry both meanings. So if I own a flying mammal, and you own something to hit baseballs with, it’s wrong to say\nYou and I own bats.\nOr at least it’s a bit off. To really see the force of the test, imagine a native Catalan speaker who thinks the English word ‘cousin’ is ambiguous between cosí and cosina. We can show they are wrong by noting that the following is a perfectly good sentence of English.\nI have two cousins: Alice and Paul.\nSo how do we apply this to ‘generous.’ It’s a bit tricky, since we can’t really have two instances in the different extensions. The closest I could get is the following. Francis thinks selfishness is bad, and Ayn thinks it is good. They both utter the words “Brian is selfish.” Is this something we can report?\nFrancis and Ayn said that Brian is selfish.\nIt sort of sounds ok to me, which I guess is evidence against the polysemy theory. But I’m not sure that either (a) that it really is bad, or (b) that it is particularly strong evidence, since we had to embed it in a ‘said that’ operator.\nVäyrynen’s Positive View\nAs I understand it, Väyrynen’s view has two components. He agrees with his opponents that a typical utterance of “Brian is generous” suggests that (the speaker believes that) Brian is good in some way. But he wants to say two things about this implication.\nIt is a conversational implicature, not something that’s part of the meaning of ‘generous.’\nIt is not-at-issue.\nLet’s go through these in turn.\nConversational implicatures, in the sense made famous by Grice (1989), are things you can infer from the fact that a speaker said what they did, and are being cooperative, but which are not part of the meaning. So if someone says “Brian fell out of bed and bumped his head,” that doesn’t strictly speaking mean that I bumped my head while falling out of bed. (At least on standard theories of how the sentence works - this is actually a tricky case.) The sentence would be literally true if I bumped my head on the staircase coming up to bed, then disoriented by the sore head fell out of bed the next morning. But it would be horribly misleading to use these words to communicate that that’s what happened. If the speaker is being cooperative, they would only say this if I bumped my head in the fall. So that’s an implicature of the sentence. Once you get the idea, you see implicatures everywhere you look.\nNot-at-issue content is a bit trickier. It’s content that is at least part of what the speaker means to communicate, but which isn’t front and center. So it would be weird to say “That’s not true” or “That’s not what happened” or anything like that, because the ‘that’ wouldn’t pick out the right thing. So think about this sentence (from the Nightvale pilot).\nOld Woman Josie, out near the car lot, says the Angels revealed themselves to her.\nThe at-issue content is that Josie made this report about the Angels. If she didn’t say that, it would be easy to object to the sentence. But it’s not quite so clear that it is part of the at-issue content that Josie is old, or a woman, or out near the car lot. Think about how you’d respond to the sentence if you accepted everything in the sentence except one of those three things.\nSo now we get to the striking part of Väyrynen’s theory - the moral valence of a thick term is both an implicature and not-at-issue. This is a bit funny, since paradigm implicatures are at-issue. But it’s not too hard to come up with examples where you get both. In fact, you can get some that look a lot like what Väyrynen wants. Think about using technical terms from a subject that people have views about whether you should care about it. So imagine some using some arcane basketball stats to describe Giannis Antetokounmpo’s performance in the Finals last summer, or saying what David Chalmers’s h-index is. This implicates that you think those statistics are important. But this implicature is not-at-issue; it would feel like changing the subject for a hearer to object to even using the terms. And note that the objector certainly couldn’t object by denying what you said.\nThat’s what Väyrynen thinks is going on with thick terms. They are like arcane stats, and the very use of them reflects a way of looking at the world that some might find objectionable. But the people who do find them objectionable won’t want to deny the claims made by the users. Nor will they never use the term, as if they were taboo or inconsistent terms. They will use the terms in saying, for instance, why they don’t approve of the theory behind them.\nIs this a good account? Let’s go over that in class. What I want to end the notes with is a bit of a discussion of where this has left us.\nFour Big Questions\nIs moral realism, either of some fairly spooky kind, or some more reductive kind, true, or is some kind of anti-realism (meaning here non-cognitivism) true?\nIs there a sharp fact/value distinction?\nAre thin terms or thick terms more central to moral philosophy as it should be done, or are they equally important?\nDo thick terms have their evaluative direction as part of their meaning, or are they just descriptive terms that are usually associated with evaluations?\nOne big way that thick terms entered philosophy was because they were thought to tell on 2, and hence on 1. The best theory of thick terms, Foot argued, implied a negative answer to 2. And a negative answer to 2 implies some kind of realist answer to 1.\nBut note how one-directional this is. You can have as strong a realism as you like, and pair that with either having a sharp fact/value distinction (as in Moore), or a not at all sharp one (Murdoch). It’s just that certain kinds of anti-realism are incompatible with there not being a distinction.\nOnce thick terms are on the table, a lot of other questions naturally arise. We haven’t made it a big focus yet (though it will become more of a focus over the rest of the term), but 3 is a really fascinating question. I touched on it a little last week in the discussion of integrity and honesty, and that led to a really interesting discussion in class I thought.\nFinally, it’s worth noting that 4, which is the organising question of Väyrynen’s book, stands in an odd relation to the rest of the questions. We’ve seen people who have just about every possible combination of answers to the first 3 questions give an affirmative answer to the last question. And if you have a negative answer to the last question, that doesn’t entail anything about the first 2 questions. At most it undermines some arguments for particular answers to the first 2. But presumably it requires you to say that thin terms are more important to moral philosophy, since thick terms are not part of moral philosophy at all!\n\n\n\nGrice, H. Paul. 1989.

Then consider the following two cases.\nA has the behavioural profile of someone who is Modest. (They don’t brag, draw attention to their successes, show irritation with people who don’t acknowledge their success etc.) But they don’t have the right mental profile at all. Deep down, they think they are the greatest. But they believe it would be wrong to act that way - it would make others feel bad about themselves and they don’t want to cause those bad feelings out of consideration for other people - so they act as if they were Modest. Is this Modesty or false Modesty?\nB has the perfect mental profile of a Modest person. But they believe that the social norms where they are require one to not act as if one is Modest. They believe those norms require self-aggrandisement and other behaviour typical of the imModest person. Is B Modest? Does it matter whether their beliefs about the norms are correct?\nBommarito argues that Modesty can’t be behavioural as follows.\n\nTheories of modesty also need to be able to distinguish modesty from false modesty. That is, some people who are not modest can act as if they are. This rules out accounts of modesty that are entirely behavioral. If being modest is simply a matter of certain external behaviors, then there would be no way to distinguish modesty from false modesty. Modesty and humility require certain mental states in addition to overt behaviors.\n\nThis seems much too quick to me. The second sentence is question-begging if this is meant to be an argument. And if the challenge is how can a behavioural theory of Modesty can provide for the possibility of false Modesty, that seems easy. To be Modest is to be disposed to generally act as if one’s achievements are no big deal. (Or something like that - what matters is the disposition.) False Modesty is not having that disposition in general, but merely being disposed to act that way in high profile or high stakes situations.\nOn this view there are instances of false Modesty, but not really such a thing as global false Modesty. False Modesty requires some imModest dispositions. But that seems plausible to me.\nAsymmetry\nAssume again that Modesty is purely mental. Maybe it’s a matter of underestimating oneself, or not over-estimating oneself, or not caring whether one is valued for achievements, or whatever. Call the relevant attitude M, and consider this case.\nC has attitude M towards all people who are great at chess. They don’t value being great at chess, they don’t care whether people who are great at chess are valued, and so on. But they do enjoy chess. And because they enjoy it, they play it a lot, and eventually get very good. But they keep attitude M towards all people who are good at chess, including now themselves. Is C Modest about their chess abilities?\nIt seems to me that they aren’t. Modesty is essentially self-directed. If one has an attitude towards a group, and then it turns out, almost by accident, that one is in the group, that can’t be enough for Modesty.\nIn general, there is surprisingly little about the self in the various theories of Modesty. All of them seem to have this feature that one could be Modest by having a general disposition towards a group and then finding oneself in the group. And that doesn’t feel like enough.\nModesty and Humility\nThis could end up being largely word-play, but maybe there is an interesting question here. Are these two the same thing?\nI don’t have a ton to say here, other than that the authors we’ve read seem to skim over the question surprisingly quickly. If I had to guess, I’d say Humility was more mental and Modesty was more behavioural. But most authors can’t say that - they think Modesty is basically mental.\nDomain-Specific Modesty\nSchueler suggests, without I think arguing for, the following picture. The fundamental logical form of Modesty statements is not X is Modest, but X is Modest about Y. To the extent that we can even understand the unqualified statement, it should be thought of as something like a limiting case, or as shorthand for something like X is Modest about themselves.\nWe certainly do have in natural language expressions like X is Modest about their successes in chess. And we can imagine people who are Modest in one domain but very imModest in another domain. But should we think that being Modest about something is the primary notion?\nI don’t really have a firm view here, or even for that matter a sense of what would settle the matter. But it’s worth thinking through some edge cases to clarify the issues. So imagine this example:\nD has a few distinct impressive accomplishments. When anyone brings up any of these except their favorite one, they play it down by changing the conversation back to how impressive that particular achievement was.\nI think D is not at all Modest. But I think on a bunch of views they’ll end up being Modest about all their achievements but one. That seems maybe a bit wrong, so I’m a little inclined to think the absolute sense of Modesty is prior. Or here’s another relevant case.\nE doesn’t have any notable achievements to speak of. But this is too bad, because they are disposed to downplay (both internally and externally) any achievements they get, and not use these as reasons for thinking or acting that they are better than anyone else.\nI guess I think E is Modest, but not Modest about anything, which is also a challenge for the view that Modesty is a dependent virtue.\nVarieties of Modesty\nWe will talk a lot next week about Intellectual Modesty, or perhaps better Intellectual Humility. For now I just want to ask about how these three notions relate.\nModesty in whatever sense we’re interested in here.\nIntellectual Modesty\nSexual Modesty\nThe standard line in the philosophical literature is that sexual Modesty is a distinct notion. I suspect this is based on a misunderstanding of the folk ethics of sexual Modesty. I think the folk view is that good looks are either an achievement, or a virtue, or at the very least a sign of achievement or virtue. (I don’t mean this to be a unified view - just that many people believe one of these disjuncts.) What we normally call sexual Modesty is, from this perspective, not bragging. It’s deliberately showing off the virtues or achievements you have. So it isn’t really a distinct category.\nIntellectual Modesty is a different thing, but here it is interesting to think about whether some people might take it to be the primary notion. I was struck that Benjamin Franklin’s version of Be Modest! was Be like Jesus or Socrates!. Because they are not examples of what I would call Modest people. I don’t get the reference to Jesus at all, but let’s think about Socrates. He does have a sort of Intellectual Humility, a weird sort but still a sort. But he doesn’t have any of the traditional sorts of Modesty. He seems to be very confident that he doesn’t act wrongly, for example. Now he does credit this to a guardian angel rather than to himself, but still it doesn’t sound Modest to me. I think what’s going on here is that Franklin is taking Intellectual Modesty to be basic, and since Socrates thought he knew very little, he qualifies as Modest.\nShould we think of Intellectual Modesty as the fundamental kind? Maybe this is something to come back to after we discuss what Intellectual Modesty is.\nDriver’s View\nDriver takes Modesty to be a certain kind of ignorance of one’s own qualities. The big challenge to Driver, and one we should discuss, is why we should think of this as a virtue. Driver is a consequentialist, who thinks a virtue just is a character trait that typically has good consequences. And it is clear that this character trait might have good consequences - it reduces jealousy, envy etc. But is that enough to make it a virtue.\nI’d also like us to go over a bunch of possible puzzle cases for Driver’s view. Let’s start with one that’s similar to C above.\nF systematically undervalues acts of generosity. They notice when people are generous, but they don’t credit people that much for it. One day they do something very generous, but in keeping with their general attitude to generosity, they don’t give themselves much credit for it.\nI don’t think this makes F Modest, though they are Modest on Driver’s account. Here’s a somewhat similar example.\nG is a very good novelist, but hardly the best in the world. G also thinks they have no ability at all to tell who is a good or bad novelist. If you ask them where they think any particular novelist ranks, they’ll say “No idea. Could be the best, could be the worst, I’m no good at telling this.” And they’ll say that about themselves just like they will say it about anyone else.\nIs G Modest about their novel-writing ability? I don’t think they are. They are Modest about something else, namely their ability to tell good novelists from bad ones. But they aren’t Modest about their ability. They really think they might be the best in the world!\nBut you might think this isn’t really a problem for Driver’s view. While G is ignorant of their novel writing ability, they don’t under-estimate it. And that’s what Driver stresses, under-estimation. (So why is it called an ignorance account?) Actually it’s worth separating out four separate views, because I think it’s a bit funny which one Driver thinks is Modesty.\nX is Modest about F if X is good at F but X’s belief about how good they are is lower than how good they actually are.\nX is Modest about F if X is good at F but X’s belief about how good they are (as a person) in virtue of being this good at X is lower than how good they actually are (as a person) in virtue of being this good at F.\nX is Modest about F if X is good at F but X doesn’t realise how good they are at F.\nX is Modest about F if X is good at F but X doesn’t realise how good they are (as a person) in virtue of being good at F.\nI think Driver’s view is option 1. (Do you agree? We probably should clarify this!) But I kind of think it’s one of the least plausible of the four options. Consider, for example, this way of separating out 1 and 2.\nH is a great chess player. Many people think the best in the world. But if you talk to H about their chess skill they will say, completely sincerely, “Well yes I do win plenty of games. But it’s just pushing some pieces around a board - it’s not like I cured cancer or something.” That is, they believe (truly) that they are incredibly good at chess, but don’t think this is something that really matters.\nOn option 1, they are not Modest, on option 2 they are. I think they really are Modest, so this is a reason to prefer option 2.\nThe case of G might be taken to suggest that option 3 is worse than option 1. But I’m not entirely sure that’s right. One thing that seems attractive about Driver’s view is the idea that Modesty involves sort of not attending to one’s own skills. There’s something nice about the Modest person being the kind of person who, when you point out to them how good they are at something, says “I guess you’re right, I just hadn’t been thinking about the comparison.” But Driver, I think, wants the Modest person to be thinking about comparisons and get them wrong. Option 3, which allows for not making the comparisons, seems better.\nFinally, here’s one case that I think is very hard for Driver, and which leads naturally into some issues for Schueler.\nJ is a great football player, one of the best in the world. J also believes, correctly, that they are one of the best in the world. And since they highly value football, they think this is a very good thing to be. But if you talk to J about their skill they will say, completely sincerely, that they themselves only played a relatively small part in their success. If it wasn’t for a whole team, from parents to early coaches to a larger system that supported them, they wouldn’t be anywhere, and that the vast bulk of the credit for their success should be spread across this team. All these beliefs they have are true.\nI think J is Modest in the sense we most care about. But they don’t underestimate themselves in any respect. What should Driver say about such a person.\nSchueler\nThis is going on a bit long already, but I wanted to note one tension within Schueler’s view. It’s helpful to bring it out by thinking about this case of J, and relating it to the theological view that Schueler discusses. Schueler needs the following things to be true.\nMany people have “genuine accomplishments.”\nThe credit for these accomplishments doesn’t go to them.\nSchueler mentions three reasons that you might support 2, and endorses (I think) two of them. The first is that the credit all goes to God. That’s the one he doesn’t endorse. The second is that the accomplishments aren’t that big a deal in the overall scheme of things. He seems at times a bit sympathetic to this. The third is that the credit for the accomplishment shouldn’t go to the person who performed the act, but to the ‘broader ecosystem.’ And this one he more strongly endorses. So we get someone like J being the paradigm of a Modest person.\nBut what I don’t get is why he thinks this is consistent with 1. Once you see that J’s success at football comes from things that don’t rebound to J’s credit, then why think it is even a “genuine accomplishment?” I guess I don’t see why we should think that the view he puts forward at the end is that different from the ‘low-ranking’ assumption on views that he wants to reject.\nThat’s not to say this is a false view. I’m inclined to think it largely is true. Indeed, I think Schueler himself should notice it more. Think about when he says that sometimes you can’t doubt how much of an accomplishment you have - you either set the world record or you didn’t. But you can doubt how much of the accomplishment you did, and how much is a team effort. So I think the “credit usually goes to the broader team” view is probably right. But I don’t see how that lets Schueler have a different view to Flanagan and others.\n\n\n\n",

Some of these look like really terrible arguments, but I think there’s a pretty good one in section 5 of McDowell’s 1981 paper (McDowell 1981).\nBut let’s start with an argument from section 2 of that paper. This argument seems to be more widely discussed, and also a very bad argument. The former is a reason to discuss it; the latter is a reason to be a bit quick about it. Here’s how I’d reconstruct the argument.\nIf non-cognitivism is true, then some reductive analysis of thick concepts into maximally thin concepts plus descriptive stuff is possible.\nIf such a reductive analysis is possible, then there is a descriptive concept that is necessarily extensionally equivalent to the thick concept.\nIf there is such a concept, then a stranger (meaning here a person who doesn’t understand our value system) could share it.\nIf the stranger could share such a descriptive concept, then they could predict how we would apply the thick concept in new cases.\nStrangers cannot predict how we apply thick concepts in new cases.\nSo no reductive analysis of thick concepts is possible (from 2-5).\nSo non-cognitivism is false (from 1 and 6).\nI’ve separated out line 1 because Elstein and Hurka (2009) are interested in replying to the argument to line 6, independent of whether non-cognitivism is true. But I think it’s common ground that 1 is true, so that extra step is fine.\nNow this argument seems bad to me because (as Blackburn pointed out straight away), there is no real reason to think that 2 is correct. Let’s take a simple example. This analysis isn’t going to work, but it’s enough to show that this argument fails. Assume that for a person to be selfish, the following conditions must all be met.\nThe person prioritises their interests over those of others.\nThe person is all-things-considered a bad person.\nAt least part of the explanation of the second point is the first point.\nThere is nothing in that which a non-cognitivist need reject. But it doesn’t follow that there is anything descriptively equivalent to ‘selfish.’ After all, not everyone who prioritises their interests over those of others is selfish; they have to also satisfy the second clause. Now I don’t mean to say that this is a good analysis. It clearly isn’t, and we’ll get back to that point. But the possibility of it suffices to show that this argument doesn’t work.\nElstein and Hurka (on page 519) say that Williams gives a version of the same argument. But they then attribute an argument to Williams which they say is the same argument. That can’t possibly be right, since Williams’s argument makes no reference to strangers. But I think 2 is part of that alternative argument as well. And maybe they think we can replace 3-5 in McDowell’s argument with:\nThere is no descriptive concept that is necessarily extensionally equivalent to the thick concept.\nI don’t know though; that seems like a bold claim. And McDowell certainly isn’t taking it as a premise, though maybe Williams is. Anyway, it seems like a bad argument, because it ignores the possibility of analyses like my toy analysis of selfish. Elstein and Hurka say that it is bad because it assumes that any analysis will be ‘Descriptively Definite,’ but I don’t think that’s the problem. I’m not 100% sure what they mean by that, but I think this analysis of ‘selfish’ is Descriptively Definite, and it shows that premise 2 is wrong.\nBut that’s not, to my mind, the most interesteding argument in McDowell’s paper. I thought the argument in section 5 of McDowell’s paper was really fascinating, but I’m not sure it has always been fully appreciated in the subsequent literature. (Not that I’ve read 100% of it, or even close.) Here’s how I’d write it.\nFrom the inside, the evaluative part of ‘honest’ feels non-arbitrary; it doesn’t seem like we just like honest things the way we might like a flavour of ice-cream. Call this the non-arbitrariness constraint.\nThe non-arbitrariness constraint requires that we can identify the descriptive features in virtue of which we positively evaluate them, and do so independently of our own evaluation.\nWe can only identify the descriptive parts of our own thick concepts independently of our own evaluations if a stranger could identify them.\nA stranger could not make this identification - this is both intuitive, and arguably the result of the long Wittgensteinian discussion in section 3.\nAnd now we have a problem. Line 1 says that our own attitudes involving thick concepts satisfy the non-arbitrariness constraint, but lines 2-4 together imply that they could not.\nThis is why I think it matters that we can’t identify the honest, or kind, or cruel, behaviors independently of our values. Given non-cognitivism, the only way we can pick out the kind behaviours are as those that morally resemble, by our lights, the paradigms of kind behaviour. But it would feel hopelessly circular to say that we admire kind behaviour because things only fall under the concept ‘kind’ if we admire them. So there is a problem for non-cognitvists here.\nAs a small exegetical point, note the (kind of jerk-ish) footnote about Ayer, where he says that this argument won’t trouble all non-cognitivists. I think he means there that Ayer would be happy to say that moral evaluations are completely arbitrary - they are just what we happen to cheer or boo. Whether that’s a fair thing to say about Ayer or not, it does mean that we should be taking McDowell to be giving an argument that works against every form of non-cognitivism. But most people who take themselves to be engaging with McDowell don’t present arguments that make any distinction amongst non-cognitivists.\nIf I were a non-cognitivist, I’d try to get out of the problem this way. All that non-arbitrariness requires is that on any given occasion of use, we can specify in a non-circular way why we admire the people we admire. And that’s possible even if we can’t specify exactly what kindness or honesty is. So think back to the selfish person. For any given selfish person, I can say why I don’t admire them: they put their interests ahead of others.\nBut here we get to a delicate point. By this account of selfishness, I don’t have a full account of why I don’t admire these people. They may do something else that makes them all-things-considered good. Is that enough to get back into arbitrariness? I think the thing to do here is to make a distinction that’s really crucial within thinking about moral explanations.\nSome moral explanations are conclusive. Given what we say in explaining the phenomena, it is necessary that the moral evaluation obtain.\nSome moral explanations are complete. Given what we say in explaining the phenomena, we don’t need anything else to infer that the moral evaluation obtains.\nAll conclusive explanations are complete, but the converse does not obtain. Or so I think; this gets at a hard question in the metaphysics of morality. To make it more concrete, think about the following example. A says that X is a bad person, and you ask why. A says “X deliberately killed a child.” I want to say this is a complete explanation; you now know enough to know why X is bad. But it isn’t conclusive. Maybe X is a bomber pilot who bombed a nuclear missile launch site, preventing the start of a nuclear war, but killing a child that (X knew) was close to where the bomb detonated. Probably that was not a bad thing for X to do. (I don’t have a lot of sympathy for either absolutist views that say X should have let the nuclear war start, or the kind of view that says it isn’t really killing if X was primarily motivated to do something else.)\nNow here’s the metaphysical point. Go back to the regular case where there are no extenuating circumstances. Does the explanation of why X is a bad person have to include the absence of extenuating circumstances? My view is that it doesn’t have to; or at least we can make sense of a theory of moral explanation where it doesn’t. On that notion, some explanations (like “X deliberately killed a child”) are complete but not conclusive.\nSo here’s how I’d respond to McDowell’s argument more carefully. Non-arbitrariness requires that we can (at least in theory) give a complete explanation of our moral attitudes in descriptive terms. But the ability of strangers to predict our evaluations requires that they have a conclusive explanation of the attitudes we have. And there is no reason that we need to have such an explanation, so no reason to think that the stranger has it.\nElstein and Hurka’s Positive Theories\nElstein and Hurka give two (and a half?) different theories. They say the second is for ‘virtues,’ but then the theory applies in the first instance to acts, so I’m a bit puzzled at exactly how the theories are meant to fit together. It’s worth setting these out a bit pedantically. Here is the first one - a bit simplified and a bit tidied up from what they give on 522. For some positive thick term T, the account says that x is T if there is some set of properties such that:\nx has every member of the set\nEach of the properties is to do with descriptive kind D (which varies for different T)\nAny y that has every member of the set is good.\nThis, like the toy analysis of ‘selfish’ will violate premise 2 of McDowell’s original argument. It’s a little trickier, but I think it will also be consistent with the inability of strangers to predict how we will continue to apply the term. The stranger might not know, even with a huge amount of data, that there is another set satisfying the second and third clause.\nHow will this engage with the non-arbitrariness concern? Here I think it does worse. If there were such sets - and we could identify their members - then our evaluations of selfish people as bad would not feel arbitrary. But if we cannot identify the sets, and Elstein and Hurka give no evidence we can, I suspect it might still feel arbitrary.\nThey give a second option for ‘virtue-related’ concepts T. The idea is that an act x is T just in case for some particular property-function D (which varies by T, but is in some sense descriptive):\nx is D(good)\nAnything that is D(good) is good.\nBy a property-function here, I mean a function that takes another property as input, and returns a property. So here’s a property function.\nD(P) = the property of sticking to a P goal despite distractions and temptations.\nWhen P is descriptive, D(P) will be descriptive. For instance D(popular) is a descriptive property, the property of sticking to a popular goal despite distractions and temptations. But note that the account here is moralised twice over. We put moral properties both into D(P), and we have a constraint that D(good) is good.\nNow the particular instances of this kind of account they give are not I think very plausible. Integrity, for example, doesn’t require stickinig to goals that in the abstract good. It requires sticking to goals that are good relative to the ‘distractions.’ Working on an open access philosophy textbook is a significant good, but it wouldn’t show integrity to avoid fighting Nazis to finish it. (The beer mats example is a poor model here.)\nThere is a bigger problem for the account of courage. Here D(P) is the property of accepting harm for the sake of things with greater P than the evil of that harm. A deontologist won’t accept that all D(value) acts are good, which they need for the definition to make sense. After all, some D(value) acts are rights violations. I think they are thinking that we can use a notion of ‘value’ in the definition that is sensitive to the badness of violating rights. But that’s a very substantial meta-ethical assumption, and it would be bad if the very definition of ‘courage’ is hostage to that definition.\nI think the stuff towards the end about relation R (on page 530) is an attempt to deal with something like this problem. But I don’t really understand how it is meant to help get around the problem that rights-based theories are going to say you need a moral constraint (e.g., that the act doesn’t violate rights) on any universal moral generalisation.\nAn Argument for Thin Centralism\nIn the objections and replies section there was an interesting argument I wanted to tease out. Let’s say that for any end E, either the following are both true, or they are both false.\nIt shows integrity to stick to a goal of producing E in the face of distractions and temptations.\nIt shows courage to stick to a goal of producing E in the face of risk of physical danger.\nIf there is this kind of correlation over possible values of E, it needs to be explained. And the thin centralist has an easy explanation. Both of these are true when E is a good end, and both are false when it is not. Does the thick centralist (like Williams) have an explanation that’s as good? Should they even concede that the correlation obtains?\nGrounding\nPreviously I’d summarised Elstein and Hurka’s view as follows: x is T iff for some D from the class relevant to T, x is good in virtue of being D. That’s not quite what they say. They don’t talk about what explains, or grounds, the goodness. They do say that it is a necessary truth that anything which is D is good. But as we’ve seen discussed ad nauseum in the last 10 years in metaphysics, necessary connections are not quite the same thing as these kind of grounding explanations.\nI think they’d be better off appealing to grounding though, especially if you allow contingent grounding. So here is how I would think it is better to give their first analysis. x is T if there is some set of properties such that:\nx has every member of the set\nEach of the properties is to do with descriptive kind D (which varies for different T)\nThat x is good is fully grounded in the fact that x has every member of the set.\nIf grounding explanations need only be complete (in the above sense) and not necessarily conclusive, this will allow that the sets might be small enough to be graspable, while it still being true that the explanations they provide are complete.\nVäyrynen’s Objections to Semantic Arguments\nI’ll end this week setting out the argument (as I understand it) in Väyrynen’s book (Väyrynen 2013). It’s not quite as clearly signposted as I would have liked, but I think it’s a pretty interesting argument.\nThere is a way of arguing for something in philosophy where the actual argument is really really quick, and then you spend forever arguing that the argument works. So think about the kind of view in philosophy of mathematics that argues that numbers exist the following way.\nThere is an even prime number.\nSo, there are numbers.\nOn the face of it, that’s a compelling argument. The premise is a familiar mathematical truth, and the conclusion follows by first order logic. So that’s that. Well, of course anti-realists about numbers have a story to tell about why it’s not so simple, and realists have to engage that anti-realist argument. But even after hundreds of pages of such engagement, there’s still a good sense in which the realist argument is just the two line argument given here.\nThat’s how I read Väyrynen’s book. There is a very simple argument that Elstein and Hurka are mistaken. And the argument also shows that people like McDowell and Foot, who take thick concepts even more seriously than Elstein and Hurka, are also mistaken. Now it isn’t that simple to tell whether the simple argument is actually any good. Just like the anti-realist can explain away the apparent argument for the existence of numbers, the supporter of either a reductionist treatment of thick concepts (like Elstein and Hurka) or a non-reductionist treatment (like McDowell and Foot) can explain away the apparent argument. Or at least they can try, and a huge part of Väyrynen’s book is about why those explanations don’t work. But the initial argument is reasonably simple. I’ll run through three versions of that ‘original argument’ today, and next week we’ll look at (a) some possible replies to it, and (b) the positive theory Väyrynen puts in place.\nVäyrynen sets up the example using ‘lewd,’ and I don’t have any intuitions at all about how ‘lewd’ works. It’s not really in my everyday speech. So I’ll instead use ‘selfish.’ And I’m interested in two possible users of the word ‘selfish.’ (At least, I want us to have these two users in mind.)\nThe first kind of user is an ethical egoist, who thinks the descriptive component of ‘selfish’ does not pick out morally bad behavior, and in fact picks out morally good behavior.\nThe second kind of user is a consequentialist, who thinks that some people produce all-things-considered better outcomes when they act selfishly than when they try to act altruistically, and so it is good for those people to be a bit selfish.\n(Actually what I personally am interested in is what’s going on when analysts say that a sporting figure should be a bit more selfish, or isn’t selfish enough. I think they mean a version of the second thing. It’s almost a platitude in soccer that the great strikers are all a bit selfish, that you have to be a bit selfish to be a great striker. So in that context selfishness is not an unqualified bad.)\nNow imagine a person, call him Suárez, does something that puts his own interests above those of some other salient person. And imagine that our speaker, Bloggs, is one of these two kinds of users. Here’s Väyrynen’s argument from negated uses of thick terms.\nIf Elstein and Hurka are right, Bloggs should deny/reject “Suárez is being selfish,” and accept “Suárez is not being selfish.” (This is because Suárez being selfish entails, according to Elstein and Hurka, that Suárez is doing something bad, and Bloggs does not believe that he is.)\nIn fact, Bloggs will not deny/reject “Suárez is being selfish,” and will not accept “Suárez is not being selfish.”\nSo Elstein and Hurka are mistaken.\nThere is a parallel argument, I think, against the kind of view in McDowell and in Foot.\nIf McDowell’s view or Foot’s view right, Bloggs should reject “Suárez is being selfish,” because to accept it would be to accept that Suárez is criticisable.\nBloggs would not reject “Suárez is being selfish.”\nSo McDowell’s view and Foot’s view are both mistaken.\nI’m not going to run through the McDowell/Foot version of the criticism in each case. But I do want to stress a structural point. Even though Elstein and Hurka set up their view as a response to McDowell, Väyrynen offers a criticism of them on the basis of what they have in common with McDowell (and hence also with Foot/Williams/etc.)\nSo that’s the argument from negated uses. There is also an argument from conditional uses.\nIf Elstein and Hurka are right, then all users, and hence Bloggs as well, should regard conditionals like “If Suárez is being selfish, he is doing something wrong” as trivial.\nBut Bloggs will not regard that conditional as trivial.\nSo, Elstein and Hurka are wrong.\nAnd there is an argument from questions. Get away from these two particular users, and think about a generic user of ‘selfish,’ who might be from these groups but probably isn’t.\nIf Elstein and Hurka are right, then asking “Is Suárez being selfish?” is to ask both about what Suárez did, and about acts like his have certain moral properties.\nBut in fact, a person who asks “Is Suárez being selfish?” is, typically, just asking a descriptive question.\nSo Elstein and Hurka are wrong.\nNow in every one of these arguments, the argument for premise 1 is fairly simple. They say ‘selfish’ has this two-or-three part structure, and premise 1 follows from plugging something with that structure into completely standard theories of assertion, supposition and questioning. The response, in every case, is that the completely standard theory isn’t quite right in this particular case. And this isn’t an ad hoc response because it turns out there are quite a few cases where the completely standard theory isn’t quite right.\nSo to finish, let’s think about a couple of cases where the standard theory fails. First we’ll do ‘regret,’ then we’ll do ‘stopped.’ (Väyrynen has examples where ‘regret’ and ‘stopped’ appear in the same sentence, but understanding these is really quite hard, and I think they are best put off until we’ve understood the simple ones.)\nTo a first approximation, Brian regrets doing X is true just in case Brian did X, and Brian wishes he hadn’t. Now think about these three sentences.\nBrian doesn’t regret drinking Red Bull and vodka for breakfast.\nIf Brian regrets drinking Red Bull and vodka for breakfast, then he drank Red Bull and vodka for breakfast.\nDoes Brian regret drinking Red Bull and vodka for breakfast?\nTo my ear, the ‘standard theory’ gets 1 and 3 wrong. If (as I hope will be the case when these notes are published) I didn’t have Red Bull and vodka for breakfast, then 1 sounds wrong, even though the negation of the truth conditions for “Brian regrets drinking Red Bull and vodka for breakfast” is true. And 3 is asking about my attitudes, not my culinary preferences. But 2 does sound trivial, just like the standard theory predicts.\nTo a first approximation, Brian has stopped doing X just in case he used to do X, and now he doesn’t. Now think about these three sentences.\nBrian hasn’t stopped drinking Red Bull and vodka for breakfast.\nIf Brian has stopped drinking Red Bull and vodka for breakfast, then he used to drink Red Bull and vodka for breakfast.\nHas Brian stopped drinking Red Bull and vodka for breakfast?\nAgain, I think the ‘standard theory’ gets 1 and 3 wrong. I think 1 is not true, even though it looks like the negation of a sentence whose truth conditions are not satisfied. And 3 seems to be asking what I’m having for breakfast now, not what I used to have for breakfast. Though, interestingly, 2 is still somewhat trivial I suspect.\nBut note the dialectic. Väyrynen has said that given Elstein and Hurka’s theory, and some trivial sounding assumptions about how language works (e.g., when a sentence is not true, its negation is true), we get false predictions about particular English sentences. At this stage Elstein and Hurka can argue that the prediction is actually true, or argue that the supplementary assumptions needed to generate it are false. And the best option seems to be to argue that the supplementary assumptions needed to generate it are false. The easiest way to do that is to come up with independent cases where those assumptions fail. That’s why we will spend a lot of time discussing regrets, and stops, and all the rest. But that’s for next time.\n\n\n\nElstein, Daniel Y., and Thomas Hurka. 2009. “From Thick to Thin: Two Moral Reduction Plans.” Canadian Journal of Philosophy 39 (4): 515–35. https://doi.org/10.1353/cjp.0.0063.\n\n\nMcDowell, John. 1981. “Non-Cognitivism and Rule-Following.” In Wittgenstein: To Follow a Rule, edited by S.

I think this kind of reflection is frequently a good thing. And I think this because if you’re a value pluralist, as I am and I think as Williams is, you have to think a lot about what happens when values conflict. If you’re a real pluralist you’ll think that some of these conflicts are irresolvable. But sometimes thinking through why you care about this or that, or why you use this or that classification, can show you that certain conflicts have clear resolutions.\nSo why might reflection be bad? Williams gives one reason - that they push you towards thinking in thin terms, and that’s bad. I don’t really buy either premise in that. But let’s look at one other possibility. Reflection is bad because it destroys the original conception. What I didn’t sufficiently notice in class was that there are two ways in which this might happen: metaphysical and psychological.\nWhat we mostly talked about in class was the metaphysical version. On this route, the problem is that even if the reflection leaves your behavior unchanged, it won’t be the same kind of virtue if it is motivated the wrong way. The example we talked about a bit was love. If you provide for your children solely because the best institutional design for child rearing involves small families, that’s not really love, even if you provide for them as well as any other parent.\nI think that’s probably right, though I think the word ‘solely’ in the last paragraph is doing a bit of work. But I wonder how many other thick concepts are like this. My intuitions might be off here, but I think love is a bit of an outlier. It’s possible to genuinely develop the character traits of honesty, courage, or empathy, on purely selfish instrumentalist grounds, so it should be easy for those to survive reflection. So one question: are there attitudes/traits other than love that are metaphysically incompatible with reflection in the sense that it wouldn’t really be the same attitude/trait if one realised that one only had it for indirect reasons? If not, that would put a pretty sharp limit on the metaphysical downsides of reflection.\nBut what I didn’t talk about in class was the psychological version. That’s possibly a bigger deal, and one I could have touched on more. Here’s the kind of thing I have in mind. Michael Strevens’s recent book The Knowledge Machine is about the strange kind of hyper-empiricism that has dominated science for a long time now. As he sees it, and I think he’s right, the kind of empiricism that is the dominant ideology in most branches of science is a really terrible epistemology. There are lots of good ways to know about the world, especially involving analogical reasoning, or appeals to simplicity, that go beyond the narrow empirical grounds that the dominant ideology allows. But, says Strevens, it is a good thing that this ‘bad’ ideology has taken hold. Because only certain kinds of empirical data are allowed as evidence in public discourse, people who come to believe things on other grounds are compelled to go find more evidence to back up their theories. Without this compulsion we wouldn’t have anyone willing to make the very detailed empirical investigations that have revealed so much about the world. So the empiricist ideology is individually irrational, but collectively valuable.\nNow there’s a tension here, one that Strevens is aware of. The ideology only works if the vast majority of people internalise it. If everyone thought, “This doesn’t make sense but it leads to good consequences so let’s keep going,” then fairly soon they’d stop doing the extra experiments, and the good consequences would stop. They’d start arguing that the ideology was only meant to be a general guide, and surely this case is one of the exceptions where it doesn’t apply, and their pet theory should be endorsed without them having to traipse through a jungle or whatever to collect the data that clinched the case for it. But we want people traipsing through those jungles! In theory, one could reflectively endorse the empiricist ideology on consequentialist grounds and keep producing the good consequences. But in practice we know that ain’t gonna happen. And you might worry that a lot of social norms are like that - if people in general were aware of why the norms produced good outcomes, they would be too willing to carve out exceptions to the norms in their own case, and the good outcomes would stop.\nHow worried should we be about this? I have no idea - it would require a much more detailed investigation into (a) what the norms of various communities are, (b) why those norms produce social benefits, and (c) what the psychological consequences would be of realising that the norms are grounded in these social benefits. I don’t know the answers to those questions in anything like the right kind of detail, but I think they would produce a more anti-reflection approach than I was allowing in class.\nRelativism and Philosophy of Language\nThe orthodox approach to semantics involves a commitment to something like the correspondance theory of truth. Declarative sentences are (typically) true or false, and when they are true, this is because they correspond to how things are. That last sentence needs a lot of spelling out. How can a sentence correspond to anything, apart from another sentence? Well, a sentence has a content. And that content can be true or false relative to various things. What things? Well, those are the matter of how things are in the platitude.\nBut how are things? It helps to work through an example. Let S be the sentence Brian is sitting. We will write ⟦S⟧ for the content of that sentence - these weird double square brackets have become the standard way for expressing the function from sentences to their contents. Now we want S to be true if, and only if, Brian is indeed sitting when S is uttered. That last bit, when S is uttered, is important. S doesn’t say that I always sit, just that I’m now sitting. How should we incorporate that into our theory.\nOne approach is to build the time into the content of the utterance. On this view ⟦S⟧t is Brian is sitting at t, where t is the time the sentence was uttered. The subscript is to say that this is the content of S at t. On this view there is no such thing as the content of S, since it has different contents at different times of utterance. Then ‘how things are’ is the entire world, from Big Bang to Big Crunch. Call the world w, for simplicity, because we’ll use it a lot. And we’ll write \\(\\vDash_w ⟦S⟧_t\\) - which you can read as saying that the content of S is true at w, to say that this content is true. This approach is called eternalism, which is an annoyingly polysemous term in philosophy. If ⟦S⟧t is true, it is always true, hence the eternal. It’s true even if I stand up, because ⟦S⟧t includes a reference to a time, and I stand at a later time. To introduce one more technical term, the time is part of the context; something that affects what the content of a given utterance of the sentence is.\nAnother approach is to build the time into how things are. On this approach the world does go from Big Bang to Big Crunch, but how things are doesn’t just involve a world, it involves a time too. (If you like you can make this time metaphysically special - like on a spotlight view - but that’s not part of the linguistic theory.) The content of ⟦S⟧ is just what it looks like: that Brian sits. But that very content is true at some times and false at others. We write this as \\(\\vDash_{\\langle w, t \\rangle} ⟦S⟧\\). This view is known as temporalism, because the things that are true or false are temporal entities, they change truth value over time. And to introduce another technical term, on this theory the index is the pair \\(\\langle w, t \\rangle\\). The index is what the sentence is measured up against.\nWhat is the difference between these views? There is a view that it’s a purely notational difference, that we shouldn’t care about which is right. But that’s a minority view. Most philosophers think there is a big issue here. The problem is that there is less agreement about what exactly the big issue is. We want contents, the outputs of the \\(⟦⟧\\) function to play some philosophical role. The problem is that there are too many possible roles for them to play. Here are five possibilities.\nThe contents of what we believe.\nThe contents of what we say (if you think we have independent grasp on this).\nThe contents of ‘that’-clauses, especially in indirect speech reports.\nThe things we agree or disagree with when we agree/disagree with an assertion.\nThe things we retract when we no longer endorse our former assertions.\nSometimes these five considerations push in the same direction. So consider the sentence I was born in Australia. That’s true when uttered by me, and false (I think) when uttered by anyone else here. But when I say it, you don’t disagree with me. And you don’t report me by saying “Brian said that I was born in Australia.” For reasons like this, everyone agrees that who the speaker is is relevant to the content of an utterance involving a first-person pronoun, not to the index. It’s not that I say something that’s true relative to me and false relative to you. It’s that I say something that’s true full stop, even though had you uttered the same words, you would have said something false. That’s for the simple reason that you would have said something different.\nBut sometimes these considerations come apart. In the temporalism/eternalism debate, some considerations push towards putting time into the index, and some into the content. And so there’s a debate here, but I’m not going to go deep into it.\nJust one quick thing to note though. I’ve talked so far as if it is obvious that worlds go into indices. And I think it is obvious that’s true. But not everyone agrees. Some philosophers have recently argued that worlds should go into contexts and hence into contents. So when I say “There is a famous detective that lives on Baker Street,” that’s false, but the same utterance would be true in Sherlock-Holmes-world. That’s because, says orthodoxy, there is a proposition That a famous detective lives on Baker Street which is false in our world and true in Sherlock-Holmes-world. But some philosophers think that just like times go into contents (given eternalism), worlds should go into contents too. So when I say “There is a famous detective that lives on Baker Street,” I express the proposition That a famous detective lives on Baker Street in w, where w is a name for our world. As I said, I think this is an absurd view, but it’s worth noting it is out there. Still, most people think that indices are non-trivial, and they include at least worlds.\nA huge amount of work in philosophy, especially in the 2000s, was on questions around the nature of context and index. In particular, these three questions took up a lot of people’s time and attention. (The first by far the most, then the second, and then the third.)\nWhich utterances are such that their truth is sensitive to context? A huge debate, one of the biggest of the 90s and 2000s, was about whether knowledge ascriptions were among them, with contextualists (about knowledge) saying that utterances like “Brian knows that cars exist” could be true in regular contexts, but false in ‘sceptical contexts.’ But this was merely one manifestation of a discipline wide search for context-sensitivity.\nIf utterances are sensitive in this way, is this because the context affects their content, or because it affects the index they are evaluated against?\nIf it does affect the index, does it do so in a uniform way, or are there some sentences that interact differently with indices to others?\nDon’t worry about the last - I’ve got it there for completeness. It’s mostly because the most important figure in this whole debate, John MacFarlane, disagrees with the way I’ve set up the debate so far. And it would be misleading to write his view out of the picture, since he is really the most important figure in it. MacFarlane’s view is particularly motivated by issues about retraction, but I’m going to set those issues aside, and mostly set the precise views of MacFarlane aside as well.\nFor an example of what’s at stake at least in questions 1 and 2, imagine that we have with us an ancient Spartan who very helpfully speaks English. And now let S be the sentence “Infanticide is wrong.” We endorse that sentence, and the Spartan rejects it. Here are three possible philosophical takes on that dispute.\nFirst, we could have an invariantist approach. One of us, presumably us, is right, and the other is wrong. This is the view that most moral realists take, though actually a lot of views that are not particularly realist could take it as well.\nSecond, we could have what I’d call a contextualist approach. When we say “Infanticide is wrong,” we speak truly. But when the Spartan says “Infanticide is not wrong,” he speaks truly as well. Why? Because our sentences have different contents. The content of our sentence is That infanticide is wrong by contemporary standards. And the content of the Spartan’s sentence is That infanticide is wrong by Spartan standards. And those propositions are both true.\nThird, we could have what I’d call a relativist approach. (Though note MacFarlane denies this is relativism; he calls this view ‘non-indexical contextualism.’) Both we and the Spartan speak truly. But we also disagree, because we endorse the very proposition that the Spartan rejects. How is this possible? Well, the proposition we are disputing is only true relative to an ordered pair of a world and a moral standard. Relative to our world/standard, it is true; relative to the Spartan’s, it is false. It’s just like if I said “There is no famous detective living on Baker Street,” that’s true, even though it expresses the negation of a proposition that a person in Sherlock-Holmes-world can truly express. In a figurative sense, we and the Spartan live in different moral worlds, so our thoughts and talk can clash, without either being wrong.\nThis was a very long response to an argument Williams briefly makes against moral relativism. He thinks it is a problem for relativism that people in isolated moral communities won’t know that there are other communities, and so won’t know to relativise their moral talk. I think this is only a problem for moral contextualism, not moral relativism properly speaking. The real moral relativist, in the sense of the previous chapter, does not think that the moral utterances that people make are in any sense about moral communities, or standards, or anything of the sort. Rather, they think that the theory of truth for the (simple) propositions those utterances express, involves relativity to communities/standards. And they don’t have to say that competent speakers need realise that, any more than competent speakers have to know anything about the physics of time in order to use tensed language.\nMcDowell\nI’m going to focus on sections 4 and 5 of McDowell’s paper, though we can talk as much as people want about 1-3 as well. But I think a lot of the last two sections is relevant even if you don’t buy the first three sections.\nSection 4 - The Meta-Ethics Conundrum\nMcDowell presents this as an argument, but I think it’s helpful to see the challenge presented in this section as a trilemma. It’s a really interesting puzzle. When I was a grad student I sort of had the impression - based on what people around me were working on - that how it should be resolved it was one of the two most important questions in philosophy. (The other was what is mental representation. I still sort of think these are the important questions, but the field has obviously changed a lot in 25 years.) Anyway, here’s the inconsistent triad.\nMoral attitudes provide reasons.\nBeliefs alone do not provide reasons.\nMoral attitudes are beliefs.\nMcDowell presents it as an argument from 1 and 2 to the negation of 3. And he presents this as something like the master argument for non-cognitivism. I don’t know if that’s quite right, but it is one of the big motivations for non-cognitivism.\nIt’s really worth noting how much this feels like a paradox. The three claims look inconsistent. And we can make them clearly inconsistent with a bit of tidying up. But they all look really plausible to me.\nWhen you get a paradox like this, one thing I like to do is to see whether you get a clearer mental map of where philosophers in the area fit by putting them into one of the three boxes depending on which of the three they reject. But, as often is the case, that taxonomy can obscure as much as it enlightens.\nOne reason that it obscures is that some people might reject more than one of these claims, and so not get easily partitioned. I don’t really like reasons talk, but I think the best translation of my view into reasons talk ends up saying that 1 and 2 are both false. I think one can believe that it is right to leave car bombs in city centers, and have no reason at all to leave car bombs in city centers. And I also think the fact that one believes that a particular action (say, leaving a car bomb in a city center) will kill children is a reason all by itself not to do it.\nA second reason this taxonomy might obscure things is that the presentation is so snappy that it leaves plenty of space for disambiguation, and some philosophers will reject different lines on different disambiguations. So consider Foot’s view, either the 1958 view we read last time or the slightly later view McDowell considers. Foot changed her views on various things, but on this point I think she stayed constant. I would naturally read Foot as denying 2. But McDowell reads her as denying 1. That’s because he wants ‘reason’ here to mean decisive reason. And while Foot thinks that a belief like that some action is rude is, all by itself, a reason to not do an action, it isn’t a decisive reason. Sometimes, rudeness is just what’s called for. I’m bringing this up partially because McDowell does, but partially because it’s a fairly general phenomenon. Once you set up a dilemma or trilemma or whatever, there will be lots of people whose response is, “Well those terms are a bit ambiguous, and on one way of reading it, I think that’s the false one…”\nA third reason, and here’s where I don’t know McDowell’s approach to things as well as I might, is that this whole way of setting things up presupposes that attitudes provide reasons. This is more than a bit controversial. Ignore ethics for a second. Imagine that I think there is a fire in the corridor. Do I have a reason to flee the building? On one picture, yeah, if I think there’s a fire the only reasonable thing to do is to get out of there. But on another picture, it depends. If there is a fire in the building, then the fire itself is the reason to flee. I might only have that as a reason if I believe (or even know) that the fire is there. But the attitude itself is not the reason; it’s something like the possibility condition of that fact being a reason.\nNow how do we restate the paradox on this way of thinking about reasons? It’s a little tricky. I mean I guess you’ll reject 1, accept 2, and then it’s an open question what you do with 3. That’s to say, once you go this route, it seems this kind of thinking can’t help settle what kinds of things mental attitudes are.\nSo for today, let’s set that picture aside, and assume that attitudes, and not just their contents, do actually provide reasons. This is probably the best line for non-cognitivists to take since it lets the argument McDowell floats get traction.\nMcDowell gives two reasons he thinks people believe 2 - the part of the trilemma he wants to reject - and then describes why both of them are bad. I think the first is very unfair, but the second does I think get at something real in philosophy, and McDowell is right to criticise it.\nThe first reason he offers is the ‘hydraulic’ theory of mind. I think the idea here is that mental states have to literally push and pull you around. In short, reasons are active. But beliefs are passive. You can have all the beliefs in the world and essentially be a library, that’s just sitting there waiting for someone to do something with the information storied in you. So beliefs can’t be the things that do the pushing around. Now this looks at best like it is an argument that beliefs alone can’t be motivating reasons. And surely this is an argument about justifying reasons. So I’m not quite sure what’s going on. But I suspect whatever force the active/passive argument has actually turns on the thing McDowell says next, which is really interesting.\nMcDowell thinks his opponent is moved by the consideration that a reason must make something (an action, another belief, etc) make sense from ‘sideways on.’ If A justifies B, then it should be clear and obvious that A justifies B. And that’s the assumption that he (i.e., McDowell) wants to reject. For what it’s worth, I think he’s right that a lot of people do make this assumption. (At least, I think the claim he made in 1981 is true of a lot of philosophers 40 years later. But I suspect it was true back then too.) And I think this really does lead to some of the more significant mistakes in contemporary philosophy.\nOne kind of philosopher who expects this kind of ‘sideways on’ view is the one who thinks there can be purely formal conceptions of rationality, and presumably that these can be objectively determined. A lot of philosophers who identify rationality with some kind of expected utility maximisation might fall into this camp, though it depends on the details of just how they define utility. I suspect something like this view, at least a non-quantitative version, is what McDowell has in mind. His opponent thinks rationality is taking the means you believe are best to achieve your desires, or something like that. And so rationality, and hence conclusive reasons, require desires.\nPersonally I find the idea that these formal conceptions of rationality can give us the neutral account of reasons very implausible, though this may be for autobiographical reasons. When I was an undergrad, the main things I worked on were arguments for and against the uses of different logics. When I was a grad student, the main things I worked on were arguments for and against the uses of different theories of uncertainty and decision. The idea that these philosophical debates have some kind of clear resolution that can provide a fixed point in reasoning about reasons seems absurd; they are some of the hardest questions in philosophy.\nThere is another kind of philosopher who agrees with McDowell about rejecting 2, but does so because they think that moral beliefs are incredibly special. So consider someone who has the Lutheran view that it is vitally important to follow one’s conscience, which we identify with their beliefs about what is good/right. They will think that one belief and one belief only can provide reasons, namely a thin moral belief. Now why would you give moral beliefs this special place. For many of them, it’s because they want this kind of neutral conception of rationality, and they think that privileging thin moral beliefs - over thick moral beliefs and over what’s actually moral - is a way to get to neutrality. But it’s really an absurd position. And while it agrees with McDowell on the trilemma, it’s a long way from McDowell’s positive view, which does not privilege thin moral beliefs in this way.\nThere are two natural kinds of ways to think that a view of reasons might reject the possibility of a ‘sideways on,’ or neutral, understanding of what a reason is. One way is to say that various facts, such that an action would involve killing a child, just are reasons whether someone identifies them or not. Another is to say that thick concepts, like rudeness, provide reasons, whether or not someone has the concept, or cares about it. And both of these seem like pretty interesting options to me.\nSection 5 - Non-Cognitivism and Grounding\nThere is a fascinating argument in section 5 that hadn’t occurred to me, and I’m not sure has gotten as much attention in the literature as it might have. The expressivist thinks that predicating a thick concept requires doing two different things - asserting that the descriptive part obtains, and whatever else they think one does with the non-descriptive part. It is very hard, even for competent speakers, to specify just what it is they are asserting, and what it is they are endorsing/prescribing. That’s surprising, but given all we’ve learned about how much people can not understand their own language, maybe it shouldn’t be too surprising. But McDowell notes that there is a deeper worry here for the non-cognitivist.\nThe evaluative part of the predication should be, at least from the inside, grounded. And it should be, or at least feel, grounded in the descriptive part. Saying that someone is honest isn’t just describing and praising them. It’s praising them for having the feature that you’re describing them as having. And even more than that, the praise isn’t like when you praise an ice cream for being tasty. It’s moral praise, which means it should be to some extent non-arbitrary.\nMcDowell’s argument, as I read him, is that if the descriptive part can’t be independently identified, then the non-arbitrariness condition won’t be satisfied. And in fact we can say something stronger. The non-arbitrariness condition perhaps requires that we identify the descriptive property independently of the evaluative property. We can’t just identify it as the descriptive property that I positively evaluate around here. That wouldn’t be a solid enough grounding. It would feel really arbitrary.\nBut it’s no easier for a fluent user of the thick concept to independently identify the descriptive part than it is for someone who doesn’t understand the values to identify the descriptive part. And that kind of person cannot identify the descriptive part - that’s the shapelessness worry from earlier in the paper. So if thick concepts work the way that the non-cognitivist/expressivist thinks they do, they should feel arbitrary to the fluent user. But they do not feel arbitrary in this way, so the non-cognitivist/expressivist is mistaken.\nI think this is a really fascinating argument, though there are a lot of moving parts in it. Here’s what I would say back if I were defending the anti-realist position.\nNon-arbitrariness doesn’t require that we provide a perfectly precise statement of why we value the thing that we value. Nor does it require that we provide a conclusive reason for valuing it. Even if we can’t say precisely what the descriptive part of what honesty is, we might be able to get close enough, so say at least that all honest people are H, where H is some descriptive property. And even if someone being H isn’t a conclusive reason for valuing/praising/approving them, it might be a sufficient reason. This is one of the tricky things about moral reasons - sufficient reasons might not be conclusive. (By a ‘sufficient’ reason, I mean that it is enough reason all by itself, in the absence of defeating extra reasons.) If you offer a sufficient reason for doing something, it certainly won’t feel arbitrary.\nSo here’s the view I’d offer. Even if the Wittgensteinian arguments work against the possibility of precisely identifying the descriptive component, they don’t work against the possibility of getting ‘near enough.’ And in this case, near enough might be good enough, because it will be enough to satisfy the non-arbitrariness constraint. But I’d be interested in hearing what other people think of this argument.\n\n\n\n",

Occasionally there are people who have a fact/value distinction in their epistemology but not in the metaphysics or theory of content. (Possibly that’s literally just me.)\nWilliams, despite being the person everyone cites as being the historically central figure in the discussion of thick concepts, doesn’t fall neatly into either camp. He does have a fact/value distinction - or at least something very much like it. So you might think he’d be in category 2. But in fact he thinks thick concepts are very significant to philosophy - though in his case the significance is a distinct kind again. He thinks that thick concepts are particularly significant ethically.\nBut he also thinks that a kind of ethical relativism is true, and he does not think that any kind of scientific relativism is true. So he needs some kind of distinction. And when thick concepts come in, they actually seem like a kind of problem for his view - since they suggest that the kind of objectivism about ethics he disparages might be defensible.\nThe Distinction\nI’ve been calling it roughly the fact/value distinction, but Williams spends a lot of ink on why that’s not, in his opinion, the right way to conceive of it.\nIt’s not the fact/value distinction because not all questions about value are on the right hand side of the distinction. In particular, a lot of questions in aesthetics are about value, but they are not (I think) on the right hand side of the distinction for Williams. He also thinks ‘fact’ isn’t right for the left-hand side, but I couldn’t really see why. It’s possible that he’s assuming some kind of minimalism about facts, so there can be ethical facts, it’s just that they aren’t scientific facts.\nIt’s not the theoretical/practical distinction either. Not all questions about what to do are ethical questions. Children fighting over a cake are engaged in a practical dispute, but not an ethical one. (Though either may try to turn it into an ethical one by invoking principles of justice.) And I think Williams wants to say that not all factual questions are theoretical ones either. There is something funny about describing my wondering where my car keys as a theoretical inquiry, though I also don’t think we go seriously wrong by this way of speaking.\nWhat he does ultimately think is that it is a distinction between objective and non-objective fields. And the explanation is interestingly epistemological. A field is objective if we can expect that there will be convergence in people’s opinions, and this convergence is explained by the opinions being correct. Or at least that’s the initial theory - I’m not sure how consistently Williams sticks to it. But even this theory is worth spelling out a bit, and it’s worth first taking a step back to something that is very familiar.\nWilliams’s Background Theory of Knowledge\nSo as many of you know, contemporary epistemology starts with the publication of a three page paper in 1963: Edmund Gettier’s “Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?” Gettier wanted to reject the follow class of theories of knowledge.\nS knows that p just in case these three conditions are met:\nS believes that p.\nThis belief is true.\nThis belief is ‘justified.’\nYou can treat the third as a placeholder for any notion that assigns positive normative status to the belief. So we could just as easily say that the belief is sensible, or reasonable, or held for good reasons, or etc. And the worry is that cases where 2 and 3 are both true, but they are true for completely unrelated reasons, don’t seem like knowledge. It wasn’t immediately realised, but there are cases of this form, actually used for refuting roughly this theory, from a few places in the history of philosophy. The following two examples are both taken from Ichikawa and Steup (2013).\n\nImagine that we are seeking water on a hot day. We suddenly see water, or so we think. In fact, we are not seeing water but a mirage, but when we reach the spot, we are lucky and find water right there under a rock. Can we say that we had genuine knowledge of water? The answer seems to be negative, for we were just lucky. (From the 8th century North Indian philosopher Dharmottara)\n\n\nLet it be assumed that Plato is next to you and you know him to be running, but you mistakenly believe that he is Socrates, so that you firmly believe that Socrates is running. However, let it be so that Socrates is in fact running in Rome; however, you do not know this. (From the 14th century Italian philosopher Peter of Mantua)\n\nIt is important in these cases to assume that the false belief is justified, reasonable, held for good reasons, whatever you think should go in 3. But it should be possible to have cases that are like that.\nSo after 1963 there were a flood of ideas about how to either add a fourth condition to this account of knowledge, or change the 3rd condition in a way that made it immune to these problems. The general idea was that we had to somehow link the 2nd and 3rd conditions, and I think something like this is basically right.\nWilliams endorses a specific version of this kind of strategy, the one defended by Robert Nozick in his Philosophical Explanations (1981). Simplifying a lot, Nozick wanted to replace the third condition with the following counterfactual.\nIf p were not true, S would not have believed it.\nThis feels like it gets a lot of everyday cases right. We say when this condition is met that S’s belief tracks the truth. And this is a good property for beliefs to have. Indeed, you can see a lot of safeguards we put on scientific experiments as aims to make sure the results of experiments, and hence of experimenters’ beliefs, track the truth about the experimental situation.\nBut it can’t be right as a theory of knowledge. A lot of problems were raised for it almost immediately by Saul Kripke, who naturally didn’t publish these problems for three decades. (See Ichikawa and Steup (2013) for more about Kripke’s lectures.) Here’s one kind of case that seems to be devastating for this view. Imagine that I’m currently completely sober, but when I drink my judgment goes awry in all sorts of ways. Then the following claims could both be true.\nI know that I’m sober enough to drive.\nIf I were not sober enough to drive, I would still believe that I’m sober enough to drive.\nAnd there are many more problems where that comes from. While Nozick’s theory was popular for a while, it is now as universally accepted as anything ever is accepted in philosophy that it simply fails.1\nIs it a problem that Williams relies on a false theory here? I don’t think it is. Because while Nozick’s theory fails, he doesn’t need that theory to be true, and there are near enough theories that are true.\nAs he notes at a few times, Williams ultimately isn’t relying on theories of knowledge here. He wants an account of what objectivity is, and he allows that people can have knowledge of the non-objective. So he could just drop the references to Nozick, or treat Nozick’s view as at best an inspiration.\nOr he could adopt the kind of theory that virtue epistemologists such as Ernest Sosa and Linda Zagzebski have endorsed. They think that the core extra condition is something like that what justifies the belief is in part the truth of the belief. We’ll say more on this when we do more virtue epistemology.\nScientific Realism\nI found the discussion of ‘science’ in chapter 8 very tough going, in part because I don’t know what he even means by science. It’s this very classically English philosophy of science that doesn’t get its hands dirty by engaging with any actual scientific work. When you look at quantum physics, do you see one step of convergence after another? Or macro-economics?\nWilliams’s theory is that we can accept a kind of realism in science because in science we have theorists whose beliefs converge, and the convergence is explained by their truth. It seems easy pickings for a dedicated scientific anti-realist, like say Fraassen (1980), to reply to this. Maybe we get convergence because theories do better and better at predicting the macroscopic phenomena. But since there are so many possible theories that predict the macroscopic phenomena, and since so many theories that approximately predicted macroscopic phenomena in the past have been rejected, that’s no reason to believe in the truth of contemporary theories.\nWhat is Objectivity for Williams?\nThroughout chapter 8 there are a number of overlapping ideas that come up as being criteria for a field being objective. And I wanted to lay some of them out, because they didn’t all seem to be the same to me.\nConvergence on Reality\nIt is reasonable to expect that people’s beliefs will converge, and that what will explain the convergence is that the beliefs are true.\n\nThis is the original, and I think official, definition of objectivity. As I said in the previous section, I think it’s actually a fairly bold claim to think that this is true of science. But it isn’t the only thing Williams puts forward.\nConvergence on Justification\nIt is reasonable to expect that people’s beliefs will converge, and and that what will explain the convergence is the same thing as what justifies the people in having their belief.\n\nThis is closer to what we see when we get onto the stuff about thick concepts later in the chapter. It’s how I interpret the slogan he repeats a few times “What explains is what justifies.” And while it’s similar to the first one, it isn’t the same. Various anti-realist approaches to science, especially those driven by anti-metaphysical views, might think that scientists’ views will converge, and that this convergence will be explained by the same phenomena (especially observational data) that justifies the scientists in their beliefs. But you can say all this while still thinking it not clear whether scientific theories are even the right kinds of things to be true.\nCo-Tenability\nEither one of the convergence criteria are met, or the end state will not be convergence, but a partition of space into people with different views. But if the latter obtains, then there will be an external viewpoint from which any person in any part of the partition can view the other cells as correct from their standpoint.\n\nI think, think, that this is what is going on in the color case. The discussion of color is very confusing. It reads to me like there is a small set of theories that are acceptable-in-Oxford-in-1985, and there is a tacit assumption somewhere that the disjunction of these is correct. There are various moves of the form If not this, then that which I couldn’t make sense of really on their own (because ‘this’ and ‘that’ are defined in terms of those theories) but also couldn’t see why they were the only alternatives.\nBut as best as I can make out, what’s important to Williams is that the people involved can see each other as being part of a broader system, and the system justifies (and makes true?) their own beliefs, but also justifies (and makes true?) the beliefs of the others.\nI’d like to say exactly how this is meant to work in the case of color, but I honestly can’t tell precisely what theory of color Williams is working with here. I can’t even really tell if he takes the canonical sentences to be things like That’s green, or Those two things are the same color. These raise quite different issues. You probably can’t use the word ‘green’ unless you have some acquaintance with our color practices. But you can say that things are the same color. And you can say that, or deny it, in cases where you have very different metamers to typical humans. (There is also the tricky fact that there is huge variation in color vision within humans, some of it surprisingly correlated with biological sex, so what ‘our’ practice is here is a bit elusive.)\nThere are two other things that get mentioned at various points, neither of which seem exactly like any of the three things said so far.\nExplanation of Error\nAn explanation of why most of us converge should also explain why some people make errors, and what those errors consist in.\n\nRepeating Term in Explanation\nThe explanation of convergence shouldn’t change the subject, and could use the term whose convergence we’re explaining.\n\nThe pattern analytic philosophers have of suspecting that if someone isn’t saying precisely something, they aren’t saying anything at all, is sometimes rather annoying. But the alternative, of saying allusive things but not quite sticking to your own terms, isn’t fun either.\nAside on Mathematics\nIs mathematics objective in Williams’s sense? As I read the text, he’s assuming that it must be, and that it’s a constraint on a decent theory of objectivity that it turns out to be objective. And he’s right to be scared of this, because it really isn’t obvious on his theory that mathematics is objective.\nThere is a big question here - do we believe mathematical claims because they are true? This is hard to adjudicate because we normally understand those ‘because’ claims in terms of counterfactuals, and counterfactuals about math being false are literally incoherent. So there is a worry that mathematics won’t be objective on Williams’s view.\nWilliams suggests another way to be a realist (or objectivist) about math - all the parts of it could in principle be believed together. But I think this is true only on a particular view about what we’re doing in math, what we might call ‘if-then-ism.’ On the face of it, it isn’t true that you can believe all of mathematics at once. Different set theorists, for example, start with different axioms, and naturally prove different things. You can’t believe all of them. You can only have Williams’s attitude towards math if you think that these folks aren’t really proving theorems are true, they are just proving that certain theorems follow from particular axioms. That’s not an absurd theory of mathematics - some people endorse it - but it should be controversial. Like with the discussion of science, this reads like someone who never actually engaged with real cutting edge technical work, and is just going off what they learned in school.\nKnowledge Involving Thick Concepts\nWilliams thinks that at least some people in cultures unlike ours can have knowledge involving thick concepts. Let’s take a particular instance of this, involving the character Laertes from Hamlet. Hamlet himself is exactly the kind of person who in questioning those norms that hold society together undermines the confidence that Williams is so keen on. But Laertes seems a pretty good ’un by Williams’s lights I reckon. Or at least not a bad ’un, and that’ll be enough. So think about (1).\nLaertes knows that it is honorable to kill Hamlet to avenge his father’s death.\nWilliams is interested in three challenges to this claim: one from tracking, one from truth, and one from reflection.\nThe tracking concern is relatively easy to deal with. Laertes’ beliefs about honor do track something reasonably well. They aren’t random. They do accord with the cultural norms of honor. They aren’t good beliefs. They encourage revenge murder. As Ophelia points out, they lead to hypocritical treatment of men and women - Laertes can have all the affairs he wants off in Paris, but if she has an affair with Hamlet, that’s dishonorable. But still, Laertes isn’t being random or capricious here. We’ll come back to whether conformity to culture is enough, but Laertes does seem to be tracking.\nThe truth concern is a little trickier. If you understand honor as meaning ‘good in virtue of X’ for some descriptive property X, then you will not think that 1 is true. It isn’t good in virtue of anything for Laertes to kill Hamlet. And here Williams simply wants to deny that’s how thick concepts work. They are action-guiding all right - Laertes kills Hamlet because that’s the honorable thing to do. But they are more directly action-guiding. They don’t tell you - oh this thing is honorable, so it’s good, so do it! Rather, they just say - oh this thing is honorable, so do it! So Williams thinks at least this reason to think that Laertes’ belief is false fails. But what does he think the truth conditions of Laertes’ belief are? I’m not sure, and we’ll come back to this.\nThe reflection concern is in two parts. First, Laertes could not hold on to this belief on critical reflection. Second, a belief is only knowledge if it could survive this kind of reflective process. I want to say more soon about reflection. Williams connects it to the Socrates, and we could think of it as being the attempt to survive the process of questions and answers that you see in the Socratic dialogues. But you could also think of it in terms of what Hamlet does - spending hours pacing around wondering about the nobility or whatever of various acts you’re contemplating. Anyway, Williams thinks that you can know things, even if this knowledge wouldn’t survive reflection. As he says, reflection can destroy knowledge. So the fact that Laertes is not reflective, and that he would have different beliefs if he were reflective, doesn’t threaten his knowledge.\nBut even though 1 is true, Williams wants to reject 2.\nIt is an objective fact that it is honorable for Laertes to kill Hamlet to avenge his father’s death.\nWhy? Well it fails most of the conditions for objectivity mentioned above. We can explain why so many people in the castle, and perhaps in the broader culture, agree about honor without invoking honor. The best explanation will be the social utility of concepts like honor. (Or at least their utility to the powerful people.) So this won’t be an objective fact.\nBut there is this further question about what those of us who reject the honor culture should say about what it is honorable for Laertes to do. Williams’s own answer is hard to parse. He gives this super weird example involving schoolkids, and then hand waves about it being something vaguely like that. But the example doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. I’m used to the idea that there are people who can mention but not use a particular charged term. (That’s a view about slurs, though one that isn’t as popular now as it was 10 years ago.) But what is going on with a term that some of us are only allowed to mention or use in indirect speech reports? Could we also use it in describing the beliefs that the schoolkids have? I don’t get it.\nAnd this is the super-hard question. There are two obvious options around here.\nSay that honor-talk is evaluative, and since we reject the evaluations, we don’t go in for that kind of talk at all - even to the extent of attributing knowledge to Laertes. I think that’s Foot’s view.\nSay that honor-talk is purely descriptive, though it maybe implicates or something that we endorse an evaluative picture. So we won’t use it unless there is a way to cancel that implicature. That’s Pekka’s view more or less.\nNow Williams I think wants to slide between these two views. But I don’t see the space there. This is surely more a reflection of my lack of insight than anything else. But I don’t know what the positive picture is supposed to be.\nTwo Notions of Reflection\nWilliams talks a lot in these chapters about reflection. But as I read it, there are two different kinds of reflection, and they play different theoretical roles.\nOne kind is reflection by theorists who are looking to explain the uses of a thick term, and especially to explain convergence in its use.\nAnother is reflection by users of the term who are worried about whether they ought to be using the term.\nThe first kind of reflection plays a major role in chapter 8. It is because our reflections on honor-talk go a certain way that honor-talk is not objective in Williams’s sense. The second kind of reflection plays a major role in chapter 9. It’s what Hamlet does, and it’s what leads to the terrible crisis of confidence that Williams is upset about at the end of the chapter.\nNow it is possible that these don’t go the same way, especially on some ways of solving the problems at the end of the last section. In particular, some ways of solving those problems will end up with us saying sure they converge on beliefs about honor because those beliefs are true. Now what makes those beliefs true will not be remotely what they think makes those beliefs true. It will be something about social practices not something about true morality or whatever. But that’s ok - as David Chalmers points out, our beliefs about tables, chairs and beer mugs aren’t made true by what we think they are made true by.\nThe Hamlet-style reflection by users is a different story. (I’m maybe cheating a little bit here. Hamlet worries about, e.g., whether suicide is noble, not about whether nobility itself is good. But I think the way he does it really does undermine the very notion of nobility.) That does seem to require stepping back and using very different notions, in a way that maybe (maybe) reflection on our color talk does not.\nBut I was surprised at how quickly Williams moves to thinking that we’ll have to use thin concepts to judge thick concepts. We could just use other thick concepts. And in fact we often do. We often ask whether the way we use certain terms or concepts is just. When Laertes sees the error of his ways, and perhaps of the honor code he was working under, he says that he is justly slain, not rightly slain. More recently, Miranda Fricker (2007) talks about judging epistemic concepts by the standards of epistemic justice. Maybe that’s wrong, we should not focus on epistemic justice and injustice but, as Kristie Dotson suggests, epistemic oppression. There are lots of thick concepts we have around for use in judging other thick concepts.\nJustice in general is a bit of a problem for Williams, and maybe we can talk about that more in class. It doesn’t really fit into his discussion of either thin concepts or thick concepts, and this I suspect reveals a weakness in the whole structure.\nRelativism\nThis has gone on a bit, but I want to end with a discussion of one brief argument in chapter 9 against a certain kind of relativism.\n\nConsider once more the hypertraditional society, and suppose that it does have some rules expressed in terms of something like “right” and “wrong.” When it is first exposed to another culture and invited to reflect, it cannot suddenly discover that there is an implicit relativisation hidden in its language. It is will always be, so it speak, too early or too late for that. It is too early, when they have never reflected or thought of an alternative to “us.” (A question from Chapter 7 applies here: how could this have come into their language?)\n\nSo this I think is badly mistaken, but for interesting reasons. I think there is an implicit two step argument here.\nThe locals are in control of at least the syntax of their language, of how many argument places their predicates have.\nIf relativism is true, then terms like “right” and “wrong” have one more argument place than people thought they did.\nSo, relativism is wrong.\nPremise 1 is fairly debatable - I think Williams is assuming some kind of internalism about the language, at least at some level. And that’s controversial. You certainly don’t want an individual level version of that principle, as we can see by thinking about time zones. But set worries about premise 1 aside, and focus on premise 2.\nThink about the (very) ordinary sentence It’s raining. Call it R. We know what it is for an utterance of R to be true. It has to be raining\nIn the place of the utterance;\nAt the time of the utterance;\nIn the world of the utterance.\nWhen I utter R on Christmas Day in Alice Springs, it doesn’t matter whether it is or isn’t raining somewhere else, or on some other day, or in some other possible world. As long as it is raining at that place, at that time, in that world, my utterance is true.\nBut this massively underdetermines what the content of R is. In general we want to say that a sentence is true if its content corresponds to the way things are. But when you have something like R, it is tricky to know what to put into the content, and what to put into the way things are. And in fact there is a choice to be made on each of the three bullet points.\nMost theorists, in fact everyone I know, thinks that the place goes into the content. That is, an utterance of R expresses a content that has the place of the utterance as a constituent, and the truth of that content is measured against a ‘place-neutral’ world. The alternative would be to say that the content is just that rain is happening, and it is measured against a world that looks a bit like a map with a “You are here” icon, and the utterance is true if it is raining at the icon. This is coherent, but I don’t think anyone thinks it. (In part because it yields weird predictions about embeddings.)\nMost theorists, but not quite everyone I know, thinks that the world does not go into the content. An utterance of R does not express that it is raining (in Alice Springs or wherever) in this world. Rather, which possible world we’re in is part of the facts that the content is measured against. We could go the other way around, and say that an utterance of R has a world-specific content. And there is some evidence for that approach. But mostly people think it’s wrong.\nAnd there is no consensus about how to handle time. Eternalism, in this context, is the view that the content of R includes the time of utterance, and that content is measured against a ‘timeless’ world. Temporalism is that the content is just that it is raining (at a place), and the world it is measured against has an icon or something saying “This is now.” And what matters is that it is raining (at a particular place) when that icon occurs. Among philosophers of language, Eternalism is the majority view, but Temporalism has a number of adherents, including some very prominent ones.\nWhy does this all matter? Because we can do the same trick about cultural relativity. Even if sentences like “It is honorable to kill people who kill your father” are culturally relative, we can ask whether the relativity goes in the content, or in the world they are measured against. And Williams’s argument assumes, without any argument at all, that the relativity goes in the content. And this is probably the wrong form of relativism.\nWell this isn’t a philosophy of language seminar (really it isn’t), so I won’t keep going. If you’re interested (or even remotely curious) you should read John MacFarlane’s excellent book Assessment Sensitivity, which as well as going into great detail on this, will also suggest ways in which the setup I’ve given here is somewhat mistaken. But that’s a debate for another, very different, class. For now I’ll just note that there are a lot more options for relativism that are taken seriously now than there were when Williams was writing, and some of the arguments here fall short because of this restricted vantage.\n\n\n\nFraassen, Bas van. 1980.

E. Moore (1873-1958, mostly Cambridge) publishes Principia Ethica. It launches the modern version of what we’d now call meta-ethics. So the focus isn’t (or at least isn’t just) about which things are good and bad, right and wrong, but philosophical questions about what we’re doing when we do ethics. In contemporary meta-ethics we focus on at least these four questions.\nMetaphysics: What kind of thing is goodness/rightness?\nEpistemology: How do we know which things are good/right?\nMind: What is it to judge that something is good/right?\nLanguage: What is it to say that something is good/right?\nI’m using this awkward locution ‘good/right’ to not choose between people who think goodness is primary, and people who think rightness is primary, though which is primary is a huge question in 20th century ethics. Moore very much thinks it is goodness.\nOn my reading, Moore is really concerned with the first two of these. He thinks goodness is a sui generis ‘non-natural’ property. I think in modern terminology he’s an anti-reductionist. And he thinks we know about it via a special faculty of moral intuition. I suspect that circa 1903 he would say that the mind/language questions are easy. To think/say something is good is to think/say that it has this special property.\nMoore says a lot of other things as well, but what’s crucial for us is this very sharp boundary he draws between the evaluative and the non-evaluative, and the open question argument that he uses to motivate that boundary.\n1920s-1930s Vienna Circle\nAfter World War I, a group of German speaking philosophers developed what came to be called logical positivism. In its strictest version, this was the view that the truth conditions of a sentence (or a thought) were its conditions of verification. And to verify something is to observe that it obtains. So any sentence that purports to be about things we cannot observe can’t actually have truth conditions. The only exceptions were definitions, or things that followed logically from definitions. This view has consequences for all sorts of things in philosophy, especially in metaphysics, philosophy of science and philosophy of mind. But here we’re interested in its effects on ethics, and in particular on the fact/value distinction.\nThis kind of view rules out Moore’s views on ethics. Moore thought that Murder is wrong is true, but its truth cannot be verified by observation. That’s inconsistent with positivism. There are three kinds of views that are more consistent with positivism.\nOne is a simple kind of relativism. To say that Murder is wrong is to say that murder violates the norms around here. And to say that something is a norm around here is to say something like that people normally abide by it, and disapprove of (even punish) violations of it, and expect others to do likewise. You can add lots of bells and whistles, but these all look like observable claims.\nA second, endorsed by Moritz Schlick (1882-1936, the principal organiser of the Vienna Circle) was to take some basic moral principles to be true by definition, and then take the rest of ethics to be the consequences of those definitions and observation. So if you think it is definitional that good acts are those that maximise happiness, then ethics is the science of working out what maximises happiness.\nA third (and ultimately the most popular among positivists) is to say that Murder is wrong is not, in fact, true. Murder is wrong of course, but when we say that, we aren’t describing some feature of the world - either some weird sui generis feature like Moore says, or some social feature, like the relativist I just suggested says. That’s ok - there are lots of things we do with language other than describe the world.\nAs the name suggests, the Vienna Circle was based in Vienna, though it had extensive connections with philosophers throughout central and northern Europe. Most of the figures in it had left-wing political sympathies, and several were Jewish. So they mostly fled Europe during the 1930s, though Schlick sadly was murdered by a former student who claimed to be defending Nazism.\n1936 - Language, Truth and Logic\nIn 1936, A. J. Ayer (1910-1989, primarily London and Oxford), published Language, Truth and Logic, setting out a version of positivism. I think in many ways it is not a very good book. It is a fairly crude version of positivism compared to what the (now disbanding) Vienna Circle had developed by that time. But it had an explosive impact not least for the very important reason that it was in English. And Ayer, whatever his other faults, was a publicist of the highest order. (And lived an amazing life. It’s worth looking up the anecdotes about him, especially the stories involving Lauren Bacall and then, much later, Naomi Campbell.)\nLanguage, Truth and Logic is a positivist approach to many of the main questions of philosophy. We’re interested in its impact on ethics. Ayer thought that claims like Murder is wrong couldn’t be verified by observation, so couldn’t be true. His suggestion was that they were emotional expressions. Murder is wrong means something like Boo murder!. This isn’t really tenable as a theory, but it’s worth having in the background.\nWorld War II happens\nThis obviously upsets the lives of many of the characters in our story, but there are two big implications I want to note.\nOne is that the Vienna Circle flees Vienna, and many of them land in America. The effects of their arrival aren’t felt immediately, but they have a big impact over time, with Rudolph Carnap (1891-1970, Vienna-Prague-Chicago-LA) and Carl Hempel (1905-1997, Princeton among many places) probably the most influential of those who fled.\nThe other is that with all the young men being under arms, there are all sorts of spots open at British Universities. And they respond with the radical idea of admitting more women. Some of the most important figures in 20th century philosophy get drawn into the field this way, with Elizabeth Anscombe (1919-2001, Cambridge), Philippa Foot (1920-2010, Oxford) and Iris Murdoch (1919-1999) being the ones most relevant to our story. Among other things, Foot and Murdoch teach seminars at Oxford in the 1950s where a then student Bernard Williams first learns about thick concepts (though not under that phrase) and how they may be relevant to the fact/value distinction.\n1953 - Philosophical Investigations\nIn 1953, Philosophical Investigations a posthumous work by Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951, Vienna-Cambridge) was published. The Investigations defies any kind of easy summary, but three big themes will be important for our purposes. One is the idea that philosophical problems often arise from philosophers misusing language, and can be dissolved by more careful attention to how the language actually works. A second is that one of these mistakes is taking the role of language in describing the world to be primitive. We should, thinks Wittgenstein, think of this as one role among many, and probably not the primary one. Notably, the other roles are typically social; one of the things philosophers have missed is the essentially social nature of language. And a third is the importance of understanding what it is to follow a rule to understanding philosophical problems.\nThe 1950s\nThere are three overlapping trends in the 1950s that are relevant to our story.\nOne is the development of more sophisticated forms of non-descriptive theories of ethics, i.e., theories that say Murder is wrong does something other than say of some act (i.e., murder) that it has some property (i.e., wrongness). Part of this comes from incorporating into philosophical thinking the many and varied things we do with language. And part of it comes from dissatisfaction with the crudity of Ayer’s emotivism. The most prominent such view is Hare’s prescriptivism, where Murder is wrong means (very roughly) Don’t murder!.\nAnother is the ‘linguistic turn,’ the move towards thinking that philosophy should start by asking about how words for philosophically significant ideas are actually used. So don’t start by asking what causes what, but instead by asking how the word ‘cause’ is used in normal language. And the same goes for ‘wrong.’\nAnd a third is the development of ‘ordinary language philosophy,’ which is especially associated with J. L. Austin (1911-1960, Oxford). This movement had several overlapping strands. One was the thought that language, especially language as used by ordinary speakers and not by high theorists, contained a number of insights that are philosophically relevant. By looking at the distinctions we make in language we can see when philosophers are running things together. The other is a movement towards a plainer style of writing. One crude but striking measure of this is that over the 1950s, the average word length in philosophy journals in England is about a letter lower than it is either before or after that time.\nWhat’s Not in Our Story\nThat’s probably enough to get us to the work in the 1980s that launches the modern discussion of thick concepts. But I want to very briefly note one dog that doesn’t bark in this story.\nIn the overwhelming majority of topics in contemporary philosophy, the debates either start, or are upended, by developments in America between about 1968 and 1975. There are a couple of fields (arguably epistemology, parts of philosophy of science) where the big upheavals happen a few years earlier, but for most debates those are the years you’re looking at. And with the very notable exception of Philippa Foot’s development of the Trolley Problem, you’re mostly looking at work done in America. (And very often by people who are young enough to be important figures for the next 30+ years, sometimes through to the present.)\nBut the debate about thick concepts mostly skips that time period. I wouldn’t normally talk about what doesn’t happen in a debate. But especially for new grad students, I want to stress just how unusual this is. It’s arguable that things have changed a bit in the last 5-8 years. But at least through the mid-2010s, for most active philosophical debates, if you wanted to understand what was going on and fill in the background, you could do pretty well by starting with the relevant texts from the late 1960s-mid 1970s. And here we’re going to have no readings from that time at all.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nThis is very much not the theme of this course. But it’s something that came up and I wanted to talk about it. Because while it might not be completely obvious to everyone taking this course, figuring out precisely how context affected linguistic expressions was kind of the biggest question in academic philosophy for much of the 2000s. We could (and very frequently did!) run semester long classes on just this topic. (My favorite was one that Jeff King ran at Harvard in 2003, which had the striking feature that precisely no one attending it, either teaching or sitting in, was actually from Harvard.) But let’s go through the details.\nThe first thing to note is that ordinary language (and I’m going to use English examples here, but this stuff is literally true of 100% of human languages) have expressions that are sensitive to the context. Let’s think about (1).\nI read a book.\nWhen I utter (1), the word ‘I’ picks out Brian. When you utter it, it picks out you. When I utter this at time t, it says I read a book before t. When you utter it at time t, it says that you read a book before t. So at least the first two words are sensitive to the context of utterance. Maybe the third and fourth are as well - but let’s not go there yet.\nHere are a few other things that are kind of obvious, but worth pointing out, about ‘I.’\nThe context it is sensitive to is very fragile - it changes whenever the identity of the speaker changes. That’s maybe, probably, unusual. In most cases when we use context sensitive expressions, the context is fixed across a conversation. (Or so most people think.)\nBecause it is context sensitive, ‘I’ resists homophonic disquotation. What I mean by that is that you can’t just say “Brian said that” and repeat the words I uttered. So if I utter (1), then (2) is true but (3) is false.\nBrian said “I read a book.”\nBrian said that I read a book.\nBecause it is context sensitive and fragile in the sense described above, a few things about agreement follow. Think about possible responses to (1). It seems like (4) is possible.\nI agree - but I didn’t read a book.\nAfter (1) you can expressly agree, while uttering the exact opposite of what I said. Relatedly, if you say (5), you are not thereby disagreeing with me.\nI didn’t read a book.\nWhy am I going over all this? Well, there are a lot of cases where we have theoretical reason to posit context sensitivity in an expression, but where the term doesn’t behave at all like ‘I.’ So let’s think about ‘rude,’ and imagine that I say (6).\nWhat Joe did was rude.\nThen you can say (7), but it seems you can also say (8).\nBrian said “What Joe did was rude.”\nBrian said that what Joe did was rude.\nOn the other hand, you can’t say (9).\n#I agree - but what Joe did wasn’t rude.\nIf you say (10), it seems like you are disagreeing with me.\nWhat Joe did wasn’t rude.\nSo ‘rude’ doesn’t really behave anything like ‘I.’ Does that mean it isn’t context sensitive? Well here’s where things get tricky. While ‘I’ is the paradigm context sensitive expression, it is a very idiosyncratic one. I already mentioned that it is very fragile. Another thing that’s weird about it is that you can’t use it as a variable in quantified expressions. So compare what happens in (11) and (12).\n[Said while pointing at Napoleon] He failed the test.\n[Said while not pointing at anyone] Every boy fears that he failed the test.\nNote that in (11) ‘he’ picks out a particular boy, Napoleon. In (12), it is a variable ranging over boys. In logic we think of these as very different roles. But English uses the same phoneme for each. And so do most (all?) human languages. If you’re looking at human languages, you’d think that the standard thing is that pronouns can be used inside quantifiers like ‘Every boy’ to range over the things being quantified over. But ‘I’ isn’t like that. You can’t use (13) to say that every boy has a self-directed fear of failure.\nEvery boy fears that I failed the test.\nMaybe ‘rude’ is context-sensitive, but it’s more like ‘he’ than ‘I.’ Or maybe, even more plausibly, it’s like ‘tasty.’ When I say that a meat pie is tasty, I don’t mean to be ascribing to it a universal property of tastiness. I know that it is, quite literally, a question of taste. But note that after (14), (15) is fine but (16) is not.\nMeat pies are tasty.\nBrian said that meat pies are tasty.\n#I agree - but meat pies are not tasty.\nIf “Meat pies are tasty” just means “I like the taste of meat pies,” you’d expect (15) and (16) to be the other way around. But what else could “Meat pies are tasty” mean? One answer, given by John MacFarlane (UC Berkeley) is that a kind of relativism is true about taste claims. But now we’re getting too far from the subject of this seminar.\nAll this complicates figuring out how words are context-sensitive. We’d like to be able to use data on agreement and disagreement, on when we do and don’t correct people, to tell what a word means. But for context-sensitive terms, these tests are hard.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\nContents\nThe Is-Ought Gap\nA Semantic Response to Prior\nAnti-Realism\nRudeness\nNo Room for Rudeness\n\nThe Is-Ought Gap\nThere is this famous principle, usually credited to Hume, which says that moral and factual claims occupy distinct realms. The bumper sticker version of it - and it actually wouldn’t be a bad bumper sticker - says No ought from an is. More precisely, there is no way to validly deduce a moral claim from a factual one.\nNow there are plenty of cases where this seems like a good bit of advice. For instance, it tells us immediately that there is something wrong with the following bit of reasoning.\nPublic opinion tolerates 100 American deaths per day in car crashes.\nSo it should tolerate 100 deaths per day from other causes.\nAnd from 2 you might get some claim like vaccine mandates are a bad thing or something. But we should already get off the boat before that. This looks like a bad ought-from-an-is argument. Someone who approves of this way of looking at arguments will say that the argument has a hidden premise. It should have gone like this.\nPublic opinion tolerates 100 American deaths per day in car crashes.\nIt should tolerate anything similar to what it actually tolerates.\nSo it should tolerate 100 deaths per day from other causes.\nAnd making premise 2 visible is useful, because it is kind of obviously false. After all, premise 2 entails that we should tolerate everything we do tolerate, and that’s pretty clearly false.\nThe lesson here is not meant to be something particular about vaccines or public opinion or anything. It’s rather a certain way of looking at moral argumentation that says that there is always a moral premise in arguments for moral conclusions. Now the question before us is whether this ‘always’ is true. You could think that the heuristic Look for hidden moral premises is a good heuristic, and still think that it isn’t always true that there are always these moral premises. So let’s turn to that question.\nIn “The Autonomy of Ethics,” Arthur Prior (1960) has these influential counterexamples to the idea that an argument with a moral conclusion always has moral premises. Let’s work through the three kinds of cases he gives in turn.\nThe first is just or-introduction, though Prior’s example should come with some kind of content warning.1\nTea-drinking is common in England.\nSo, either tea-drinking is common in England, or all New Zealanders should be shot.\nPrior notes that if you think the conclusion is non-ethical, then the following works as a counterexample.\nEither tea-drinking is common in England, or all New Zealanders should be shot.\nTea-drinking is not common in England.\nSo, all New Zealanders should be shot.\nThe big assumption here, and one we’ll come back to, is that a statement is either factual or descriptive. If you want to say of this statement that it is sort of one, sort of the other, then you can (sort of) avoid the objection. But that’s really all you need.\nThe second argument involves null quantification.\nNo one is over 20 foot tall.\nSo, no one over 20 foot tall may sit in an ordinary chair.\nAgain, if you want to deny that the conclusion is an evaluative statement, we could offer the following argument.\nNo one over 20 foot tall may sit in an ordinary chair.\nBrian is over 20 foot tall.\nSo Brian may not sit in an ordinary chair.\nThe third example is in some ways the closest to our interests in this course. Prior’s own version is I think a bit needlessly complicated, so let’s substitute a slightly simpler one. (I’ve seen people quote something like this version when describing Prior; this simplification isn’t at all original.)\nBrian is a baker.\nSo Brian ought to do everything that all bakers ought to do.\nNote that the conclusion is not just a restatement of the premise. It could be that the premise is false and the conclusion true. Imagine that the only thing anyone ought to do is worship God. Then the conclusion would be true even if (as is fact the case) I am not a baker. But the conclusion does follow from the premise.\nThe big question here is whether the conclusion is really a moral conclusion. Prior notes one big reason that you might think that it is not a moral conclusion; the term ‘ought’ can be substituted with all sorts of other terms and the validity of the argument is preserved.\nBrian is a baker.\nSo Brian wants to do everything that all bakers want to do.\nA Semantic Response to Prior\nNext I want to go over a recent response to Prior by Gillian Russell. This is set out in part in a paper she co-authored with Greg Restall (Restall and Russell 2010), and partially in a sole authored paper (Russell 2011). I’m not 100% sure I agree with Russell’s response, but I think it’s a very good way of setting out how Prior’s arguments look from a certain perspective. And it’s that perspective that I want us to be able to focus on for the next little while.\nThere are two big assumptions behind Prior’s paper.\nSyntactic Distinction\nThe distinction between ‘is’ sentences and ‘ought’ sentences is broadly syntactic; it’s about which words appear in the sentence, and where they appear in them.\n\nExhaustive Distinction\nThe distinction between ‘is’ sentences and ‘ought’ sentences is exhaustive; every sentence is in one or the other.\n\nRussell’s response rejects both of these assumptions. She wants to understand the distinction semantically, not syntactically, and she rejects the exhaustiveness assumption. The second of those rejections is easy to explain - she thinks some sentences are neither descriptive nor evaluation. And in particular, disjunctions like Tea-drinking is common in England or all New Zealanders should be shot is on neither side of the divide. But the first rejection is more interesting for our purposes, and takes a bit longer to explain.\nTo offer a semantic conception of something, in this sense, is to explain it in terms of models, and in particular using semantic concepts - like truth, satisfaction, reference etc - in models. Here we’ll be focussing on truth in a model. What’s distinctive here are the kind of models being used. The models are going to be sets of worlds, as in standard models. But the worlds themselves will have structure. They will be ordered pairs \\(\\langle d, m \\rangle\\), where \\(d\\) is a full description of the descriptive, ‘is,’ part of the world, and \\(m\\) is the moral theory in the world. Sentences will be true or false relative to these pairs, not relative to purely descriptive claims. So if \\(d\\) makes it true that Brian is a baker, and \\(m\\) makes it true that all bakers should shave, then \\(\\langle d, m \\rangle\\) makes it true that Brian should shave.\nNow we could at this point spend a lot of time going into what kind of thing \\(m\\) is, and what kind of options there are for it. But that would be a different kind of course. Just note for now that \\(m\\) will be some kind of mathematical structure whose ordinary interpretation will be in terms of maximally thin moral/ethical/evaluative notions.\nWith this in mind, we can offer an account of what it is for a sentence to be descriptive or evaluative.\nA sentence \\(S\\) is descriptive iff for any \\(d, m, m^\\prime\\), the sentence has the same truth value in \\(\\langle d, m \\rangle\\) as it has in \\(\\langle d, m^\\prime \\rangle\\).\nA sentence \\(S\\) is evaluative iff for any \\(d, d^\\prime, m\\), the sentence has the same truth value in \\(\\langle d, m \\rangle\\) as it has in \\(\\langle d^\\prime, m \\rangle\\).\nThat is, descriptive sentences don’t change their truth value when you change the moral part of the world. And evaluative sentences don’t change their truth value when you change the descriptive part of the world. And those both seem plausible enough claims\nNow note on this picture that a lot of sentences will be neither descriptive nor evaluative. A disjunction of a descriptive and an evaluative sentence will be neither. A conjunction of a descriptive and an evaluative sentence will be neither. Depending on how you understand \\(m\\), all three of the conclusions in Prior’s arguments will be neither.\nBut that said, it will definitely be true that a descriptive sentence, or set of descriptive sentences, never entails an evaluative sentence, unless it’s a trivial evaluative sentence like Killing is wrong or it isn’t, or a contradictory descriptive sentence like Killing is common and it isn’t. Why? Well, the conclusion is non-trivial, so it is false somewhere. Call that somewhere \\(\\langle d_1, m_1 \\rangle\\). And the premise is non-trivial, so it is true somewhere. Call that somewhere \\(\\langle d_2, m_2 \\rangle\\). Since the premise is descriptive, it doesn’t change truth value when you change \\(m\\), so it is still true at \\(\\langle d_2, m_1 \\rangle\\). And the conclusion is evaluative so it doesn’t change truth value when you change \\(d\\), so it is false at \\(d_2, m_1\\). So there is a world, namely \\(\\langle d_2, m_1 \\rangle\\), where the premise is true and the conclusion false. So the argument isn’t valid.\nIs this enough to rescue the no ought from an is principle? I think to answer that you need to answer two questions. First, how worried are you that so many sentences turn out to be neither descriptive nor evaluative? I’m a bit worried about this, but I’m not sure how worried I should be. Second, how happy are you with understanding worlds as pairs like \\(\\langle d, m \\rangle\\)? And this I think is the big question.\nHere’s what I take Russell to have made a decent case for. If you’re happy with understanding worlds as pairs like \\(\\langle d, m \\rangle\\) then there is a response to objections like Prior’s. It’s not a pain-free response - it involves having this huge class of neither-descriptive-nor-evaluative sentences - but it’s a response. And honestly if you did like no ought from an is, you probably should have been thinking of worlds as being something like these kinds of pairs all along.\nNow one way to think about the core puzzle we’re going to be thinking about for the next few weeks is whether the best theory of thick concepts/terms is consistent with this way of thinking about worlds. One way to think about Foot’s very different challenge to no ought from an is takes it to be a direct attack on that very way of thinking about things. So let’s turn to Foot’s paper.\nAnti-Realism\nLet’s start by looking at how Foot sees the debate about anti-realism (I won’t here distinguish expressivism from non-cognitivism unless I have to) circa 1958. There are two things that I want to stress that may seem different to how they seem nowadays.\nOne is that Foot does not agree with the relatively simple causal story I told last week. I think that story is widely believed nowadays, but since Foot was closer to the action than contemporary commentators, I want to put her version on the table as well.\nHere is the causal story I told. Moore proved that the only viable form of realism was non-naturalism. Later philosophers agreed with the proof, but couldn’t handle the non-naturalism, so they gave up realism. That’s very much not the story Foot tells.\nOn Foot’s telling, Moore’s argument is little more than Hume’s No ought from an is principle. And that principle needs support, it can’t be taken as given. And the support it gets comes from varieties of anti-realism. It’s because we think Murder is wrong is an imperative not an assertion that we think Moore’s argument goes through, and not vice versa. Now as I said, I’m not really sure that’s the way things played in the 1920s and 1930s, but I think Foot’s view is worth taking seriously.\nThe other thing that is striking is what she takes to be the main problem with anti-realist theories: they can’t explain moral arguments. Now while this isn’t a million miles from the Frege-Geach problem that became the biggest issue, it is a real challenge.\nIt’s clearly true that we do make moral arguments in our everyday life. If the conclusions of these are means to be expressions or imperatives, we need a story about how such arguments might work. The best non-cognitivist theory has two parts. One is that moral arguments are like practical arguments. Just like we might discuss what to do tonight and conclude Let’s go to a movie, we can discuss morality and conclude with an imperative. The other is that for these arguments to work, there has to be something practical in the premises. Moral arguments can’t start from nothing; they have to start from some level of moral agreement. It’s this last condition that Foot disagrees with. She thinks that arguments about morality don’t need an agreement on moral starting point any more than arguments about the shape of the earth.\nIt turns out not to be crucial to the plot line of this paper, but it is striking that at the top of page 505 Foot thinks that one of the problems with anti-realism is that it would lead to subjectivism about moral evidence. And this is bad, because subjectivism about evidence is bad. What’s striking about this from a contemporary perspective is that subjectivism about evidence is taken much more seriously now than Foot allows. It is very common to say that a person can decide for themselves “what is evidence for monetary inflation or a tumour on the brain.” If evidence is probability raising, and probability is fairly permissive, then this kind of subjectivism will be true. (We could go into a long digression here about the particular puzzles of finding evidence concerning inflation, but that’s for a very different course.)\nThere are some amusing asides about anti-realism later in the paper. You can think of much of the paper as a kind of dilemma for expressivists. Either they are cognitivists (moral attitudes are beliefs) or non-cognitivists (moral attitudes are not beliefs, and more like feelings). The first horn gets you into problems like at the bottom of 508 - some things that are intuitively possible become impossible. But if you’re a non-cognitivist, you get into the troubles described on 509. And that’s where we get this amusing pair of lines.\n\nTo suggest that he could refuse to admit that certain behaviour was rude because the right psychological state had not been induced, is as odd as to suppose that one might refuse to speak of the world as round because in spite of the good evidence of roundness a feeling of confidence in the proposition had not been produced. When given good evidence it is one’s business to act on it, not to hang around waiting for the right state of mind.\n\nThere is also an interesting point at the top of 506 about the “special use of fact” that the expressivist needs. Early expressivists, notably Ayer, got into all sorts of trouble with triples like these.\nMurder is wrong.\nThere are no moral facts.\nIt is a fact that S, iff, S.\nBy 1 and 3 we get that it is a fact that murder is wrong, seeming to contradict the claim in 2 that there are no moral facts. The expressivist needs a way out of this. The way they normally take is to posit an ambiguity in ‘fact.’ In the ordinary sense of ‘fact,’ 2 is false and 3 is true. In the special philosophers’ sense, 2 is true and 3 is false. But this leads to two problems. One is that this special philosophers’ sense might involve just the kind of metaphysics that the expressivists pointedly wanted to get rid of. The other, which Foot rightly stresses, is that we haven’t got a good account of this special sense.\nI think Foot here is getting at something that has become known as the problem of creeping minimalism. Minimalism about truth and facts, like in 3, is very attractive for expressivists. But it threatens to undermine the very statability of their view. They need to say things like 2 in order to be distinctive. But things like 3 make that hard to say.\nThe standard solution, which again Foot sees coming, is to give an explicitly contrastive account of this special philosophers’ sense of fact. (I think Allan Gibbard might be the clearest proponent of this approach.) What we really mean by 2 is that things like Murder is wrong are just not made true in the same way that things like The cat is on the mat is made true. There are a lot of things we might say about this contrastive approach, but let’s just note one that’s particularly relevant to Foot. If you go this way, you can’t use expressivism/non-cognitivism to motivate a fact/value distinction, because you need the fact/value distinction to even be able to state the anti-realist view.\nRudeness\nSo the part of this paper that is most relevant to us, and really the heart of the paper, is the discussion of rudeness. So let’s spend a bit of time going over it. And I want to separate out a few different things Foot says about rudeness.\nRudeness is Evaluative\nAs Foot says on 507, she takes “rude” to be an evaluative word. To call someone, or something, rude is already to make a negative evaluation. It might not be an all-things-considered negative evaluation, but it is a negative evaluation nonetheless.\nThis matters because it affects what we think a violation of the Humean gap looks like. For Foot, the counterexamples will have this form.\nFred did X.\nSo, Fred was rude.\nAnd that’s it - a descriptive premise and an evaluative conclusion. This isn’t the only way one could use ‘rude’ to get to a puzzle. You could use it as the middle step, like in…\nFred did X.\nSo, Fred was rude.\nSo, Fred acted wrongly.\nAnd now you could argue that the middle step is either descriptive, in which case the argument from 2 to 3 is a counterexample, or evaluative, in which case the argument from 1 to 2 is a counterexample. That’s not what Foot does. She just uses the argument from 1 to 2.\nAnd I suspect she does this because she doesn’t think the argument from 2 to 3 is valid. As she notes, there are cases where being rude is the right thing to do. She says she is setting those cases aside, though I didn’t at all see why this was playing fair. You can’t just set aside whatever you choose I think. But perhaps she is being more sensitive to this point than that way of putting makes it seem.\nAnyway, the thing I want to take away from this is that it is misleading to treat her as holding that “rude” has descriptive and evaluative elements. Rather, it’s an evaluative term that has some descriptive constraints.\nCausing Offence\nI couldn’t always tell just what Foot thought rudeness was. The initial account, on the bottom of 507, is\n\nThe right account of the situation in which it is correct to say that a piece of behaviour is rude, is, I think, that this kind of behaviour causes offence by indicating lack of respect.\n\nThere are a few things to unpack there. For one, it isn’t obvious that this is a morally neutral description. The ‘lack of respect’ condition at the end is arguably evaluative. But maybe whether something ‘indicates a lack of respect’ is a descriptive condition even if ‘respect’ is itself a moral notion. We could also I think ask if ‘offence’ is evaluative or descriptive, but perhaps it is descriptive enough to let through.\nIn this account, what matters is that the kind of behaviour causes offence. On the next page, the inference is from behaviour actually causing offence to it being rude. This seems odd twice over. For one thing, the reference to lack of respect dropped out. For another, we’ve gone from talk about kinds to talk about individual actions.\nAn account in terms of kinds seems clearly superior. I can rudely gossip about someone behind their back, but if I’m a skilled enough gossip I will never cause offence because they will never find out it was me. Or I can be rude to someone’s face, but if they are distracted it may not actually cause offence. Now what’s true is that the kind of behaviour I engage in on both occasions does cause offence.\nUsually this talk about properties of kinds of activities does not mean that a kind has a property as long as one instance has that property. A single goat that tap-dances does not make goats the kind of thing that tap-dance. So it might be that some action causes offence (by indicating lack of respect) without being the kind of action that causes offence. It might just have been that someone around took offence at very strange things.\nThis raises a problem I think for the argument on 508. We have to be very careful about how we specify what goes into O. The wording on 508 suggests it is that some offence was actually caused. But that is neither necessary nor sufficient for rudeness. We can totally say that offence was caused but the action wasn’t rude; it’s just that the other person was hyper-sensitive. (A celebration of sporting success might cause offence to very thin-skinned opponents without being rude.) I think Foot can get out of the problem here by saying that O isn’t a claim that this action actually causes offence, but that it is a kind that typically does. But this is a tricky point, and if we’re going to argue that there is a metaphysical necessitation here, we have to watch out for slippages.\nRelatedly, the last line of the paragraph that runs from 508 to 509 makes very little sense to me. It seems fine to apologise for rude behaviour while acknowledging no offence was caused. In the middle of an office rushing to meet a deadline, I might do something rude, quickly apologise, even while noting that everyone is so busy that no one had time to even be offended. There isn’t anything incoherent about this at all. So I don’t really understand what the argument here is supposed to be.\nNo Room for Rudeness\nIt’s only a couple of sentences, but I want to end the discussion of Foot with what she says in the middle of 509. This is the question that will become centrally important in what we discuss in a couple of weeks time. What should we say about the person who rejects the concept of rudeness?\nIt’s clear what Foot wants to say about the kind of person she has in mind. (Which may not be the kind of person we have in mind.) They will just not use terms like ‘rude,’ and we can’t have any kind of conversation with them about rudeness, etiquette, or anything similar.\nI worry here that there are two kinds of people that are relevant, and Foot is running them together.\nPeople who think ‘rude’ is like ‘phlogiston,’ a term from a failed theory.\nPeople who can reliably track rude behaviour, but do not believe that it has any moral significance.\nWhat Foot says makes sense about people in category 1. But I’m not sure what she has to say about people in category 2. Indeed, it is arguable that she doesn’t really believe in category 2, she thinks this is sort of a way of being in category 1.\nI’ll leave it there with the notes, though we’ve got plenty more to talk about in class. And if we have time we’ll get onto the short introduction to thick concepts at the very end of Chapter 7 of Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy.\nBut we’re not moving straight on to Williams. Instead we’ll stick with the chronological order, and next week look at John McDowell’s shapelessness thesis. This is interesting both for its connection to a bit of 20th century philosophy that is talked about way less than just a few years ago - Wittgenstein on rule following - but also because it firmly connects thick concepts to moral realism.\n\n\n\nPrior, Arthur. 1960. “The Autonomy of Ethics.” Australasian Journal of Philosophy 38 (3): 199–206.\n\n\nRestall, Greg, and Gillian Russell. 2010. “Barriers to Implication.” In Hume on Is and Ought, edited by Charles Pigden, 243–59.

Rather than do that, I’ll follow common practice and start by just pointing out various examples. I’ll list terms here because it’s easier to list them than to list concepts, though our interest here is if anything more on the concepts than the terms.\nSo start by considering the words in these two lists.\nHonest, Fair, Brave, Friendly, Generous, Tactful\nWicked, Cowardly, Rude, Nasty, Selfish, Cruel\nWe will mostly recognise the first as terms of approval, even as distinctively moral kinds of approval, and the second as terms of disapproval. But that kind of boo/hooray doesn’t exhaust what is typically communicated by the terms.\nIt is perfectly consistent to say that something was good but not tactful. It may even be consistent to say that it was tactful but not good; let’s come back to that. What matters for now is that saying something is tactful isn’t just to express approval of it; it’s to approve of it in a particular respect. And if the thing doesn’t have that respect, then it isn’t tactful.\nTo take a very topical example, it would be very strange to describe the withdrawl of US troops from Afghanistan as tactful. If you disapprove of the withdrawl, then sure that’s easy to explain; you don’t like using positive terms to describe something you disapprove of. But even if you do approve of it, you might still think that while the withdrawl was good, it wasn’t good in the way that tactful things are good. You might think that the US actions were not tactful, and this is for broadly speaking descriptive rather than evaluative reasons.\nThe terms on these two lists are related to something like moral or ethical evaluation. But really for any kind of evaluation we can think of terms that seem to have these evaluative and descriptive aspects. So think of all of these broadly aesthetic terms.\nBeautiful, Sublime, Stylish, Elegant, Balanced, Delicate\nGarish, Messy, Crude, Ugly\nThe first group seem more or less positive, the second more or less negative. But they don’t just have these evaluative senses; they seem to have descriptive aspects to them. One can like, and approve of, a piece of music without thinking it beautiful. (How much of the Velvet Underground’s first album is beautiful? How much does that matter for how good the album is? Can something have a beautiful taste or smell? I don’t think so; a paper plane might look beautiful, but can it taste beautiful?) And the other terms are even more contentful descriptively.1\nThe album that launched 1000 bandsWe can do the same thing for evaluations to do with rationality, whether it is epistemic or practical.\nShrewd, Open-Minded, Humble, Insightful, Perceptive\nGullible, Stubborn, Shallow, Lazy\nWe’re going to cover epistemology a lot more in this course; let’s leave it there for now.\nSo far I’ve been dividing up the terms into the good ’uns and the wrong ’uns, but one thing that is super important is that there are plenty of terms that are nowhere near this easy to classify. The main book for this course, Pekka Vayrynen’s The Lewd, The Rude and the Nasty (Väyrynen 2013), makes these terms the centerpiece of the main argument. So let’s list a few contentious ones already.\nPekka VäyrynenLewd, Chaste, Blasphemous, Sinful\nThe idea that Vayrynen wants to build up is that these terms encode a moral system that we might well want to reject. Oddly, although Vayrynen wants to disagree with Bernard Williams (1985) about approximately everything to do with these thick terms, the possibility of such terms is also central to Williams’s story. That’s because Williams thinks that these terms are most at home in particular moral systems that need not be universally shared. One of his aims on getting us to focus on thick terms is to make moral relativism more appealing. Different cultures use different thick terms, but they are still using moral theories when they do so. But these are different theories, so of course the terms from other systems will strike us as defective in some way or other.\nBernard WilliamsThere are three more contentious terms that I want to spend a little time on before we move on.\nOne is really a class of terms: slurs. These seem to also have descriptive and evaluative components. If you call someone a bogan or a chav you’re probably insulting them.2 But you’re also making a descriptive claim, one that could be wrong. Donald Trump, for instance, is neither a bogan nor a chav, even if much of his sales pitch is targeted at people who might well fall into one or both of these categories. And this seems to be the general case with slurs; they have both descriptive and evaluative elements. But for most slurs, maybe including ‘bogan’ and ‘chav,’ the evaluative aspect is based in a bad moral theory. This is most obvious for the most obvious racial slurs, but it’s kind of true across the board. This isn’t a seminar on slurs, but slurs will be often in the background.\nThe second pair, which we will spend a lot of time on, is ‘humble’ and ‘modest.’ I’m not really going to separate these two, though maybe if it’s interesting enough we can. What I will spend a lot of time on is whether these are positive terms at all, and if so how they are. There’s that old line, sometimes attributed to Winston Churchill, about a modest man with much to be modest about, that gets at why you might worry about these being positive.3 And we’ll see in the philosophical theories of them, it’s very hard to come up with stories about humility and modesty that make them unambiguously positive.\nA modest manThe third kind of case I want to think about, and really just to flag, is that with a strange enough moral theory, almost any term can be positive. Think about ‘selfish’ as used by a devotee of Ayn Rand. This is going to be more grist for the view that Vayrynen pushes, that these terms are not actually evaluative at all, just descriptive. We’ll spend enough time on that in later weeks; I’m just flagging it now.\nAs well as the contentious terms, we should also think about the terms that are in a sense primarily descriptive, but which one could object to on evaluative grounds. Here are some examples, which will be relevant as we go along.\nMurderer, Thief, Liar\nFootballer, Artist, Philosopher\nJoke, Artwork, Song\nThe first three rely not just on something happening, e.g., some object being acquired, but on an evaluation of that happening, e.g., that the acquisition was of something a different person had a claim to. The second three rely on at least a minimal standard of quality being met. Whether a teenager is a footballer depends not just on whether they kick a ball around, but on how well they do it. There are bad footballers, but if you’re bad enough, you’re no longer a footballer. And the same goes for the last category. A bad enough joke isn’t actually a joke.\nIf you think of thick/thin as a spectrum, and I think it’s more or less a consensus now that you should, then these terms are at the opposite end from terms like ‘wicked,’ ‘intelligent,’ ‘beautiful,’ and other terms that don’t tell you very much about the descriptive attributes of the thing under discussion. But they still have many things in common with other thick terms, and it’s worth remembering their existence when we consider theories of thick terms.\nOne last introductory point that will be very relevant for the second half of the course. Most of these terms can be applied either to token actions/thoughts/intentions, or to agents as temporally extended beings. But, at least intuitively, they seem to apply in the first instance to agents, not to actions. That’s to say, at least intuitively the following theories seem like they are on the right track to me.\nFor someone to be a good person just is for their actions (or perhaps intentions) to be good.\nFor something to be a generous action (or intention) just is for it to be the kind of thing a generous person would do.\nFocussing on these terms, or concepts, draws our moral attention to people, in all their messy complexity, and away from individual actions or thoughts. And maybe that’s a very good thing. Whether or not it is, it’s quite a momentous thing, and it’s something we should pay attention do before jumping ahead.\nPuzzles about Definition\nSo far I’ve I ostended over 30 terms I’ve called thick terms, as well as noting that the class includes slurs, so you can probably add that many more again to the class off the top of your head.4 It would be good at this point to have a neat definition of our subject matter, to say what it is for something to be a thick term.\nUnfortunately, that isn’t going to happen. Any proposed definition will involve way too much theory. People who disagree with the theory can more-or-less agree on the existence and rough extension of the distinction we’re setting out. So the definition of the distinction can’t be in these theoretically contentious terms.5\nFor instance, you might borrow the venerable fact/value distinction and say that a thick term is one that has both factual and evaluative components. To say that Gen is a thief is to say that he brings things into his proximity, factual, and that he shouldn’t do this, evaluative. But this is wrong for at least four separate reasons.\nIf you’re a moral realist, you’ll think it is a fact that it is wrong for Gen to bring these things that belong to other people into his proximity.\nThis way of putting it assumes that we understand what it is for terms to be evaluative, and indeed that terms are evaluative, and both of these are contentious. (Note that Kirchin (2018) thinks that a big part of what’s wrong with the literature is that we’ve misunderstood how terms are evaluative.)\nThis way of putting it assumes something like Separability; the idea that thick terms have two different parts, one evaluative and one ‘factual.’ And that’s not just contentious; it’s mostly taken to be false.\nAnd the whole setup assumes a fact/value distinction - and the reason these terms were first made salient in philosophy was to undermine the very existence of that distinction. Much more on this to come.\nWilliams (1985) goes a different way. He says that the distinctive thing about these terms is that they are both ‘world-guided’ and ‘action-guiding.’ I take it he’s picking up here on something like the idea of mental states having a ‘direction of fit’ from Anscombe (1957).6. We want both our beliefs and our desires to have true contents. But what differs between beliefs and desires, at least in paradigm cases, is how we react if they don’t. If our beliefs have false contents, we change the beliefs. If our desires have false contents, we change the world. The world guides our beliefs, and our desires guide our actions. Or at least that’s the simple case; our attention will be on the cases that are less simple. To hold that Gen is a thief, on this picture, is to be in a state that should be guided by the world - it should be a reaction to Gen bringing certain kinds of things into his proximity - and should guide action - e.g., by punishing him. (Or, I guess more likely, using better locks when he’s around.)\nElizabeth AnscombeBut this won’t work either, again for several reasons.\nSome moral realists, most notably I guess Murdoch (1970), insist that moral attitudes are world-guided.\nSome philosophers, including me, deny that moral attitudes are (properly) action-guiding.\nI think we’re best off just sticking with the lists.\nDescriptive Equivalence\nI want to flag a question for now because we’re going to come back to it a lot in what follows. Let’s say you’ve got one of these sorta-descriptive/sorta-evaluative terms. And for some reason you want to factor out the descriptive part. Maybe you don’t actually share the views that make the evaluative part make sense. Or maybe you want to explain the term to someone who doesn’t. To make things concrete, maybe you’re trying to explain what a thief is to someone who really doesn’t get property norms, and can’t figure out how they work.\nIris MurdochIt’s actually kind of hard. Probably the best way to do it would be to try again to explain the moral theory of property - not as something they necessarily should endorse but as something they should understand - and then say that to be a thief is to violate this theory in certain ways. And maybe that could work, though I think it’s going to be tough.\nThis wasn’t much of an argument - we’ll see more thorough arguments in weeks to come - but it suggests the following conclusion.\nThere is no term that has the same descriptive meaning as ‘thief,’ but without the moral connotations.\nIn the language of thick concepts, there is no descriptive equivalent to ‘thief.’ The parallel claim in the slurs literature would be that a particular slur, like ‘bogan,’ has no neutral counterparts. And I suspect both of them are right.\nWhat would follow if this claim is right? We’ll spend a lot of time on this too. But one thing that you might think follows is that it’s bad news for views that say thick terms can be factorised into a descriptive and an evaluative part. And that in turn would be bad news for theories that require the possibility of such factorisations. It’s time to turn to such theories.\nSelf-Indulgent Interlude 1: Moral Motivation\nThe reason I’m interested in this stuff is that I’m in print defending what sure looks like one of those theories. Now I want to stress that theories like mine are not why people have been typically interested in thick concepts. But they are relevant to me, and it’s my seminar, so let’s start.\nCover art for Normative ExternalismOne of the core theses of Normative Externalism (Weatherson 2019) was that it is not good to be motivated by doing good as such. So I want to contrast these two cases.\nThere is a drowning child in the pond. Jill does not want the child to drown, so she jumps in and rescues the child.\nThere is a drowning child in the pond. Jack doesn’t care about whether or not children drown, at least under that description. But he does care a lot about doing the right thing, whatever it turns out to be, and he believes (correctly) that right now doing the right thing would be jumping in to rescue the child. So he jumps in and rescues the child.\nI’m committed to the view that what Jill did is much better, morally speaking, than what Jack did. Officially in the book the view is that being motivated by the desire to do the right thing, whatever it is, has no positive moral value. Actually I think something stronger than this - that it’s a vice.7\nThere is a common argument for the kind of view I have: the Nazi argument. The Nazis were horrible in every respect, yet at least some of them were motivated by a desire to do the right thing - while of course having horrible beliefs about what was right. So the fact that the Nazis were trying to do the right thing - under that very description (or at least its German translation) - isn’t a virtue of theirs. This argument is super sloppy, and I don’t really feel like trying to tidy it up, because I don’t think using Nazis in this kind of debate is helpful. There are messy historical questions about just what kind of motivations different Nazis actually had. And even if we sort those out, how to map Nazi attitudes onto regular categories from moral psychology is a hard and unpleasant question.8\nA better argument comes from thinking about terrorist groups, especially groups that have self-consciously moral aims. And within those, especially groups whose ends are ones that we might find basically congenial, however much we disagree with them about means. So in the book I spend a bit of time talking about Jacobins, mostly drawing on the discussion in Palmer (1941). But I suspect it would have been better to focus as well, or perhaps instead, on IRA terrorists, as discussed in Keefe (2019). I just don’t think you should look at people murder single parents because of flimsy evidence that they were providing trifling help to the government, and say that “Well, at least they thought they were doing the right thing.” Instead, I think you should see their overarching desire to do the right thing as having removed a very useful guardrail that most of us have on our actions - that little voice Socrates talks about that warns us against doing something so abhorrent.\nThe original terroristSo what I’d really like to say is this. A good action just is one that is driven by good intentions. And good intentions are intentions that are driven by desires to promote descriptively individuated states that are in fact good, while also desiring to avoid (or perhaps prevent) descriptively individuated states that are in fact bad. It’s to be like Jill - to jump in because a child is drowning.\nNow if there was a clear descriptive/evaluative distinction, that would all be fine. I mean, it would still be controversial, but it would at least make sense. But what do we say about someone who…\ndid X because it was the only fair thing to do?\ndidn’t do X because it would be stealing?\ndid X because it was the bravest thing to do?\ndidn’t do X because it would be lazy to do it?\nI have views about each of these questions. But I don’t have anything remotely like a theory that produces these verdicts as theorems. So this is why I’m interested in the topic. But it’s not the standard reason. That has to do with anti-realist ethical views.\nNon-Cognitivism and Expressivism\nIn mid-century England, the dominant meta-ethical view was a kind of anti-realism. This view had two components. Both of them are, I think, best understood comparatively.\nOne component of the view concerns mental content. We have a rough idea of what it is to believe a descriptive proposition about the world, like that the cat is on the mat.9 To hold that murder is wrong is not, they think, anything like that. Maybe it’s to disapprove of murder. Maybe it’s to desire not to murder, or that anyone else murders. Maybe it’s also a desire to punish in some ways those that do murder. What it isn’t is a belief that this action type, murder, has some moral property, being wrong. And that’s because there is no such property.\nGiven this view about mental content, a view about linguistic content is just about forced. To say that murder is wrong is not to describe the world in any way. Again, don’t think too hard about what makes something a description - just that it’s what we do when we say that the cat is on the mat. We’re not doing that when we say murder is wrong. What are we doing? Well, in the crudest version of the view, more or less the one defended by Ayer (1936), we’re saying Boo murder!. A moral philosophy talk, properly interpreted, sounds like the crowd at some underperforming football club.10 The view on mental content is non-cognitivism, the view that moral attitudes are not cognitive states. The view on linguistic content is expressivism, that the role of moral terms is to express these (non-cognitive) states.\nThese are normally taken to be views in meta-ethics; they aren’t moral theories, but views about what moral theory is. And towards the end of the 20th century, the focus of the debate around it turned on technical questions like how moral terms behaved in antecedents of conditionals. Since If Boo murder!, … isn’t even grammatical, it’s hard to explain what If murder is wrong,… means.\nBut in the 1950s, that wasn’t the concern. Rather, the concern was that this meta-ethical theory led to bad moral theory. Or, almost as bad, that it led to not actually doing moral theory. Since we shouldn’t really spend too much time theorising about what we cheer or boo, we shouldn’t have moral theory be a central part of philosophy. Actually put that bluntly that doesn’t sound like a great argument. But as a matter of fact normative ethics had fallen in importance, and these kinds of anti-realist views, non-cognitivism and expressivism, had taken hold, and maybe there was a causal connection there.\nNow the first big entry of of thick concepts into the philosophical debate comes as a response to this kind of anti-realism. The term ‘thick concept’ isn’t used, but the idea is right there. And it’s not attacking anything about the details of one or other account of what non-cognitive state a moral attitude is, or just how moral terms behave in antecedents. It’s really a straight up attack on the very idea that there is a boundary between the moral and the descriptive, a boundary whose existence the non-cognitivist needs to presuppose. And this is what you see especially in the work of Philippa Foot (1958) and Iris Murdoch (1956). We’ll spend much more time on these next week, so I’m just going to flag them here.\nBut why did people have these kinds of anti-realist views in the first place? The simple answer is that it was a response to the arguments that G. E. Moore (1903) made, and we’ll spend the rest of this week looking at those arguments.\nSelf-Indulgent Interlude 2: History of Analytic\nThere is a standard story about the history of analytic philosophy. In this history, logic and philosophy of science play a particularly central role. A lot of the tools that are central to today’s philosophy of language are developed over the story, but the lead characters don’t care that much about natural language, so the relation between this work and philosophy of language is complicated. But logic and philosophy of science are central to the story.\nIn the standard story, there are three big figures towering over the field: Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein. Note that two of these wrote in German, and one of them was in a math department not philosophy. Those features are not atypical. Most of the other important figures wrote in German, and several of them would have identified as mathematicians rather than philosophers. So think of the philosophical importance of figures like Hilbert, Gödel, Tarski, Schlick, Carnap, Popper and so on, with Cantor as an important influence if you reach further back.\nBut while these figures are important, I think this leaves a huge amount out of the story. In particular, it leaves out value theory. In much of the 20th century, value theory had a split role in the university, as you see in the title of Liz Anderson’s first book: Value in Ethics and Economics (Anderson 1995). Very roughly speaking, the more quantitative part of value theory was done in economics, the more qualitative part in philosophy. That was never wholly true, and with the recent rise of formal ethics is less true than before, but it wasn’t wholly false for many decades.\nIn the 19th century though, especially in England and Scotland, there really wasn’t a distinction here. The people we now think of as the most important figures in economic thought all had very thorough training in philosophy. And the best philosophers read, and often contributed to, economic thought.\nI think the history of analytic philosophy should include, and arguably start with, some of these philosopher-economists. The most important figures here are probably Jevons (to my mind the first in the tradition we call analytic philosophy), Edgeworth and (though he’s a more complicated case) Marshall.\nWhy am I including this here? Because the peak of this tradition came with two great philosopher-economists who interacted with Moore, namely Keynes and Ramsey. Keynes’s doctoral work was a theory of probability that was designed to respond to some challenges Moore raised, and Ramsey’s theory of probability - which is probably still the dominant version in philosophy today - is a response to some issues in Keynes’s. There is this rich interaction between philosophy and economics that was lost after World War Two, but which we should understand if we want to know the history of our discipline.\nWe also have this amazing document of what it was like to do philosophy at the time Moore was writing Principia Ethica, Keynes’s posthumously published memoir “My Early Beliefs” (Keynes 1938). I’m not sure everyone would call it a philosophy paper, but it’s my favorite ever philosophy paper, at least to read. I learn a bit more about the time period every time I read it, so I don’t want to leave you with the impression that there is only one thing to learn about it. But here’s what I want to stress for today.\nIn the middle of Keynes’s paper there is this long list of questions about, as he puts it, mensuration. Some of them feel like how many angels on the head of a pin. But some of them are just what we spend time talking about today. Just to pull out one example, though completely not at random.\n\nIn valuing the consequences did one assess them at their actual value as it turned out eventually to be, or their probable value at the time? If at their probable value, much evidence as to possible consequences was it one’s duty to collect before applying the calculus?\n\nNow what I want to stress is how unlike this is to everything else that’s happening in philosophy at the time. Pick up any philosophy journal and you will find lots of articles about the nature of the Ideal, and very few about duties to collect evidence before action.11 But a lot of what Moore discussed, along with his very devoted followers, seems continuous with what we do today.\nThe Open Question Argument\nMoore has been so influential on meta-ethics over the last 120 years that it is easy to place him using familiar language. That’s because the language developed in no small part in response to his work.12\nMoore is a moral realist. He thinks that moral properties exist, that some things have them and that others don’t. At least in Principia Ethica, he has an extremely anti-relativist form of realism, though that gets at least a bit qualified in later works.\nHe is, in the language that Vayrynen uses, a thin centralist. He thinks the key notions in ethics are things like goodness, rightness and what one ought, all things considered, do.\nHe is a consequentialist. He thinks that what makes something the right action is that it produces the best consequences. In Rawls’s terminology, he thinks that the good is prior to the right.\nAnd he is an agent-neutral consequentialist, again at least in Principia Ethica. He thinks that what is absolutely good is prior to what is good for me or for you, if we can even make sense of those notions.\nBut he is not in any recognisable sense a utilitarian. He is a value pluralist; he doesn’t think that there is just one thing we should try to maximise. And that one thing is not purely mental. He thinks, anticipating some environmental ethics, that it would be better for the world to be beautiful rather than ugly, even if no one was around to appreciate it. And, famously, he believes in the principle of organic unity, or what we might call value holism. The value of a whole is in no sense the sum of the value of the parts.13 I don’t know precisely how we want to use the term ‘utilitarian,’ but I think it probably should be reserved for people who believe at least some of the things that Moore is denying here.\nG. E. MooreAnd now we get to the most contentious term of all: Moore is a non-naturalist. Just what this means is not easy to say. It does not mean that he thinks goodness is some kind of supernatural property. The way Moore uses words, divine command theories are naturalist. This is one bit of terminology that has not caught on. The simplest thing to say, in modern lingo, is that Moore is an anti-reductionist.\nIt’s this anti-reductionism that is meant to be supported by the infamous open question argument. Here’s how a modern presentation of the argument might go. We’ll come back to how much Moore says anything quite like this. Consider any proposed reduction of goodness to some descriptive property D. According to the reduction, goodness is D. But we can sensibly say, “That is D, but is it good?” Its goodness might remain an open question for us even after we concede it is D. So goodness is not D. And since D was arbitrary, it follows that goodness isn’t anything else.\nAs it stands, there is a simple response to this argument. Who is the ‘we’ who can sensibly ask the open question? It can’t be those who know that goodness is D - the question won’t be open for them. Moore thinks there are no such people, but he can’t take that as a premise; that would make the argument obviously circular. A natural hypothesis is that it is competent users of the language. But now we have the familiar point that competent speakers of the language need not be on top of all reductions. We have a successful reduction of water, it is H2O. But for someone who doesn’t know this bit of chemistry, the question “Does this water contain oxygen?” might be an open question. So if you restrict things to people who know that goodness is D, the question is not open, and if you don’t, the openness of the question doesn’t prove anything.\nI think this is a pretty conclusive response to what I was calling the open question argument. But there are at least three reasons to think that at this point we’ve misinterpreted Moore. First, nothing that has been said so far distinguishes ‘good’ from ‘horse.’ In both the argument and reply, you could replace ‘good’ with ‘horse’ and everything else would go through smoothly. Yet whatever else Moore is doing, he is trying to show a way in which ‘good’ is different from ‘horse.’ Second, this makes the argument sound like it really is about meanings of words. And again, Moore is very clear that he doesn’t care about meanings in the ordinary sense. Think, for example, about the parts where he is mocking someone who thinks that the fact that something falls in the extension of a particular English word is a reason to do it. He does talk about definitions, and we’ll have to come back to that, but he isn’t talking about word meanings. Third, there seem to be two arguments in §13, which looks like the key section, and neither of them seem to be the modern presentation of the argument - though both of them eventually get close to it.\nSo what is Moore trying to do, if he’s not providing an argument about the meaning of ‘good?’ He is asking what the metaphysical definition of goodness is. This idea of there being metaphysical definitions somewhat dropped out of philosophy for a while - it really is the kind of metaphysics that the positivists wanted to be rid of - but you can see it in some contemporary philosophy. I think what Moore is up to here is continuous with the discussions of metaphysical semantics in Writing the Book of the World (Sider 2011). Moore thinks that the language of the book will include a word much like ‘good,’ but it won’t include a word like ‘horse.’ If you want to really say how things are, you shouldn’t talk about horses; you should talk about horse parts and their arrangement. But you should talk about goodness.\nWhat then is the argument for that conclusion? It seems on the face of it Moore gives two arguments, one in §13(1), the other in §13(2). And neither I think is the standard open question argument. The argument in §13(1) goes like this.14 Let D be an arbitrary proposed definition of goodness; we’ll show it fails.\nIt makes sense to ask whether it is D that X is D. E.g., it makes sense to ask whether it is desirable to desire that we desire to desire beauty.\nIt does not make sense to ask whether it is good that X is good.\nSo goodness is not D.\nOr perhaps the argument is this - I really can’t tell quite what’s going on in premise 2.\nIt makes sense to ask whether it is D that X is D. E.g., it makes sense to ask whether it is desirable to desire that we desire to desire beauty.\nAnyone who understands the question of whether it is D that X is D will understand that it is not the same question as whether it is good that X is D.\nSo goodness is not D.\nThe point is not we might be competent users of a term and not recognise correct metaphysical reductions. That’s an obvious consequence of thinking about ‘horse’ for a minute. Rather, it’s that fully informed users of the terms will recognise the differences between these questions.\nWhy believe premise 2 in either case? Here’s where I think Moore gets closest to the standard presentation of the argument. What he really needs is that fully informed speakers of the language of the book of the world will see that there is a difference between It is D that X is D and It is good that X is good / It is good that X is D. Now his opponents think they will not. Who’s right? Well the claims sure seem different to us pretty-well-informed speakers, and maybe that’s evidence that they seem different to fully informed speakers. I’m not sure. In any case, it’s already a bit interesting that the argument is about these claims where D appears twice; I don’t think the standard presentation does that.\nThe discussion in §13(2) gets closer to the standard presentation. But it’s very odd. I can’t really tell who the opponent is supposed to be here, and I suspect that’s about to become important. He says in the first sentence that the opponent is the person who says that ‘good’ is meaningless. I think this is the view that ‘good’ doesn’t have a counterpart in the book of the world not because like ‘horse’ it can be reduced, but because like ‘phlogiston’ it wasn’t needed. But I’m super not sure - that’s the person he says he is targeting - but this doesn’t make best sense of what follows.\nSo what does follow. Well, let D1, D2, D3, etc be different proposed reductions of goodness that people might have tried back in the previous argument. Then we get the following argument.\nFor each Di, it makes sense to ask whether Di is good.\nEach of these questions has something in common.\nIf goodness had no meaning, these questions would not make sense, or at least wouldn’t have anything in common.\nSo goodness has a meaning.\nThen Moore puts the two parts together. By the second argument, goodness has to appear in the book of the world either directly, as part of the basic language, or indirectly, as something else that gets reduced to it. But by the first argument it can’t appear indirectly. So it must be a fundamental feature of the world. And that’s what the non-naturalist realist wants.\nNow one giant caveat needs to be put on the board here. In both §13(1) and §13(2), the discussion around the argument gets very close to what I’m calling the standard presentation of the open question argument. But ultimately I don’t think that’s the argument. I think the argument is about the non-identity of second-order claims involving D, and the intelligibility of questions about whether D is good. But on the latter part what matters is not the possibility that such a claim is false, as in the standard presentation, but that such a claim is true.\nSo that’s Moore. Why is he relevant to our story? Well a lot of philosophers thought that a lot of the arguments he made were successful, but that his conclusion - non-naturalist realism - was unacceptable. So they wanted a way out. And non-cognitivism was advertised as being a way out of the argument.\nIf D is good just means Hooray for D!, then you can accept a lot of Moore’s premises without accepting his conclusions. Asking whether it is good that X is D is different to asking whether it is D that X is D. The latter is asking a factual question about the world; the former is asking whether to cheer for a different fact. And asking whether D1, D2 etc are all good does make sense, and the questions do have something in common. They are all questions about what one cheers for - that’s the common factor. And of course this approach handles the standard presentation of the open question argument - which probably does show up in something like this form in Ayer (1936) - just as smoothly. Of course it makes sense to ask X is D, but do I cheer it? for any D.\nSo that’s where our story starts. Moore convinced people that a certain kind of reductionist naturalism was a non-starter. Wanting to hold on to ethics, but not at the price of non-naturalism, many philosophers responded by adopting non-cognitivism. But this relied on a heavy-duty fact/value distinction, and seemed to undermine the philosophical significance of moral theorising. And the first significant push back against non-cognitivism came from people who wanted to complicate the fact/value distinction, with thick concepts as their primary weapon for muddying the waters.\nFor Next Time\nThere is no class next week for Labor Day. I’m not going to write anything this long for any upcoming class - I didn’t mean this to be this long. But we’ll cover three things.\nArthur Prior’s objections to Hume’s “No ought from an is” principle.\nPhilippa Foot’s discussion in “Moral Arguments,” especially the discussion of rudeness.\nIf time, Williams’s introduction of the term ‘thick concepts’ in Chapter 7 of Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy.\nOf these, the priority is point 2; I plan on having us go through that paper pretty carefully. But hopefully we’ll have enough time to say something about Prior and Williams as well.\n\n\n\nAnderson, Elizabeth. 1995. Value in Ethics and Economics.

Anyway, these are both broadly social slurs aimed at a particular kind of less wealthy person.↩︎\nThough since the target of the quip is usually said to be the person who was in fact the greatest ever British PM, maybe this example doesn’t show very much.↩︎\nHow many more might depend on your cultural upbringing; the variety of slurs in circulation seems to vary a lot from place to place.↩︎\nIs this an open question argument? Maybe! Foreshadowing…↩︎\nSee Humberstone (1992) for much more background on this.↩︎\nWe maybe even have a word for it in English: ‘self-righteousness.’ But whether that’s exactly the right word for this character trait is less interesting to me than whether the trait is a vice↩︎\nThe evidence in Ohler (2016) that they were taking all the drugs does not make this task any easier.↩︎\nActually, you probably don’t want to think too hard about what kind of attitude those folks thought was involved in believing the cat is on the mat. But it’s a world-directed notion, in some sense of ‘world’ and ‘directed’↩︎\nSorry I guess to fans of Arsenal/Newcastle/Schalke or whoever is triggered by this analogy.↩︎\nI think that, for example, Bosanquet’s “Hedonism Among Idealists” (Bosanquet 1903) is much more representative of the period.↩︎\nI’m drawing a lot on Hurka (2021), especially in the first few paragraphs.↩︎\nThis is implicit in Jevons’s work, but it’s Moore who really makes it central to philosophical discussions of value.↩︎\nAnd note that Moore’s particular example of D involves second-order desires, just like the theory in Lewis (1989). It’s really so much more contemporary sounding than so much else that was going on at the time.↩︎\n",

The first part concerns philosophical work on the nature of thick concepts, and in particular whether the existence of these thick concepts poses a threat to the idea that there is a fact/value distinction. The second part of the course concerns particular thick concepts, with a special focus on those that are relevant to both ethics and epistemology.\n\n\nPhoto by VasenkaPhotography via Creative Commons.\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\nThere is a Canvas site for this course, which can be accessed from https://canvas.umich.edu. Course documents (syllabus, lecture notes, assignments) will be available from this site. Please make sure that you can access this site. Consult the site regularly for announcements, including changes to the course schedule. And there are many tools on the site to communicate with each other, and with me.\n\n\n\nRequired Materials\n\n\nThere is one required book for the course.\n\nThe Lewd, the Rude and the Nasty: A Study of Thick Concepts in Ethics by Pekka Väyrynen. (This will be referred to as LRN in what follows.)\n\n\nIt’s also highly recommended that you get\n\nEthics and the Limits of Philosophy by Bernard Williams. (This will be referred to as ELP in what follows.)\n\n\nThick Evaluations by Simon Kirchin - this is freely available at https://global.oup.com/academic/product/thick-evaluation-9780198803430. (Look for ‘open access’ in top right.)\n\n\nThere are some assigned readings from it, but I’ll try to make them available to anyone who doesn’t have a copy. But if you’re working in ethics, it’s probably one of the books you should have on your shelf anyway.\n\nThe other readings will all be available through the university library, and will be linked on Canvas.\n\n\n\nCourse Requirements\n\n\nParticipate in the classes each week, having done the reading.\n\n\nWrite four ‘weeklies’ at some point during the term. A weekly should be a 2-3 page paper making one good point (either a criticism, or an application to some other debate) about the reading for that week. These do not need to include summaries of the text; assume the reader knows what you’re talking about.\n\n\nIn every week that you don’t write a weekly, leave (at least) one question about (at least) one of the papers from the reading on the Canvas discussion boards.\n\n\nWhen possible, answer some of the questions on the boards, and contribute to discussions there.\n\n\nWrite one short paper (about 10-12 pages, or about 3000 words) on one of the topics we discuss in the course.\n\n\nThe weeklies, and the short paper, may be co-authored. (I don’t know what it would be to co-author a question, though you should give credit to someone if the question came out of discussions with them.)\n\nSummary of Grading System\n\n\nParticipation in discussion boards and online classes - 20%\n\n\nWeeklies - 4 by 10% = 40%\n\n\nShort paper - 40%\n\n\n\n\nPlagiarism\n\n\nAlthough team-work, and even co-authorship, is encouraged, plagiarism is strictly prohibited. You are responsible for making sure that none of your work is plagiarized. Be sure to cite work that you use, both direct quotations and paraphrased ideas. Any citation method that is tolerably clear is permitted, but if you’d like a good description of a citation scheme that works well in philosophy, look at http://bit.ly/VDhRJ4.\n\nYou are encouraged to discuss the course material, including assignments, with your classmates, but all written work that you hand in under your own name must be your own. If work is handed is as the work of two people, you are affirming that each person did a fair share of the work. (Note that when you’re submitting work on Canvas, you have to each submit the paper, even if it is co-authored. That way Canvas knows that everyone has turned in work.)\n\nYou should also be familiar with the academic integrity policies of the College of Literature, Science & the Arts at the University of Michigan, which are available here: http://www.lsa.umich.edu/academicintegrity/. Violations of these policies will be reported to the Office of the Assistant Dean for Student Academic Affairs, and sanctioned with a course grade of F.\n\n\n\nDisability\n\n\nThe University of Michigan abides by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and other applicable federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability, which mandate that reasonable accommodations be provided for qualified students with disabilities.\n\nIf you have a disability, and may require some type of instructional and/or examination accommodation, please contact me early in the semester. If you have not already done so, you will also need to register with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities. The office is located at G664 Haven Hall.\n\nFor more information on disability services at the University of Michigan, go to http://ssd.umich.edu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass Schedule\n\n\nStudents must read the following before Monday’s class session. Important: class readings are subject to change, contingent on circumstances and the progress we make as a class. Students are encouraged to attend lectures and check the course website for updates. The links to readings will often be to things behind paywalls, but they are (I believe) all things you have access to through the UM library. You might have to be logged in to UM to get them though.\n\nFor each week, we’ll go through the readings in the order they are here. That doesn’t mean they are in order of importance; a couple of times there is a reading I want to focus on, but we need to briefly discuss something else to set it up. So each week I’ve starred the one that is really most crucial, though it might not be stuff we start with. Also, we’ll open each week with an open floor for any questions/comments/etc about anything on the list. After that I’ll work through things in the order they appear here, with the intent of going in the order shown.\n\nIt might not be obvious, but many of the paper titles below contain links to places the paper is accessible. (In some cases, that includes places where I have made them accessible, mostly legally.)\n\nNote that because we really aren’t expecting everyone to do the recommended reading, if you want to make a point about something in the recommended reading, you might need to provide a bit of background to any comment. (This isn’t important for the discussion boards, but it is important in class.) But you should assume everyone is familiar with the required readings, especially the starred ones.\n\n\nWeek 01, 08/30: The Fact-Value Distinction\n\n\nLRN chapter 1, especially subsection 1.4.2.\n\n\n*G.

This is writing/grading time for most students, so we certainly won’t do new material. But I think there will be value in having a chance to review what we’ve covered, and for anyone to discuss things that came up when they were doing more reading for the short papers.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
